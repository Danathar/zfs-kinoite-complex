#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse gate on the Bash tool.
#
# `.claude/settings.json` denies the Read tool this repository's secret-shaped
# paths -- the signing key, a .env, any private key -- and allows `git diff`,
# `git log`, `git show` and `git blame` with no prompt. Those are rules on
# different tools: a deny row on Read says nothing about what an allowed Bash
# command opens or writes, and this family of commands carries one primitive of
# each kind.
#
# The read primitive: `git diff` compares its operands as plain files rather
# than as repository content as soon as two operands are given and either one
# is not a revision, so it prints any file this uid can read -- untracked,
# gitignored, or outside the checkout entirely. Reading the signing key with
# the Read tool prompts; the diff form did not.
#
# Six things this gate has to get right, each of them a spelling that a
# simpler check misses:
#
#   1. The mode has no required flag. `git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` prints
#      the file with no `--no-index` anywhere in the command, because git
#      enters that mode on its own once two operands are given. Matching the
#      flag string alone sees nothing.
#   2. The shell rewrites the command before git sees it. `--no-'index'` and
#      `--no-\index` both reach git as `--no-index` while a substring test on
#      the typed spelling finds neither.
#   3. `--` does not end the mode. `git diff -- /dev/null ./cosign.key` prints
#      the file: git's own scan (builtin/diff.c, cmd_diff) consumes a leading
#      `--` and then applies the same two-operand test to whatever follows.
#      Only an operand *before* the `--` stops that scan, which is why
#      `git diff HEAD -- path` can never be a plain-file read but
#      `git diff -- a b` can.
#   4. A lone `-` is an operand, not a flag. Git diff reads it as stdin and
#      counts it toward the same two-operand test, so `git diff /etc/shadow -`
#      prints the file. Skipping every dash-prefixed word -- which is right for
#      `--stat`, `-U0` and the rest, since git rejects an unknown one -- leaves
#      the operand count one short of the refusal.
#   5. Git decides inside-or-outside on the spelling, not on where the path
#      lands. `git diff -- ../<checkout>/cosign.key -` names a file inside this
#      repository by a route that leaves it and comes back; git calls that
#      outside and prints the file, while a test that folds `..` first sees a
#      tidy in-tree path and allows it. See `path_inside_worktree` below.
#   6. Bash expands braces before splitting words, so one word here can be two
#      words at git -- `git diff {/dev/null,./cosign.key}` -- and a flag name
#      split by a brace is no flag at all to a matcher working on the typed
#      spelling: `--outpu{t,t}=FILE` reaches git as `--output=FILE`. Both
#      refusals below are rebuilt by four characters. Braces are refused
#      inside a git invocation rather than expanded; see `BRACE_MSG`.
#
# The write primitive: `--output=FILE` sends the diff git would have printed to
# a path instead of stdout, so an allow-listed, unprompted call overwrites any
# file this uid can reach -- `cosign.pub`, which is the signature trust anchor
# committed here and copied into the image; `ci/inputs.lock.json`;
# `.claude/settings.json`; this hook; `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The deny rules
# are no help, because they gate the Read tool and say nothing about what an
# allowed Bash command writes. The operand scan below cannot see it either: it
# skips every dash-prefixed word, and it stops tracking git at the subcommand,
# while `git log -p --output=FILE` and `git show --output=FILE` are allow-listed
# and reach the same primitive. `git show` refuses the flag only for a
# *combined* diff -- a merge commit -- and writes an ordinary commit's diff in
# full, so "git show rejects --output" is not a reason to leave it out.
#
# The written content is diff-framed rather than byte-clean, which matters less
# than it sounds: the `+` lines carry whatever the caller committed, and for a
# trust anchor or a config file corruption alone is the event. Nothing
# legitimate needs the flag -- diff, log and show print to stdout, which the
# agent already reads -- so the refusal is the whole git invocation rather than
# one subcommand. `--output-indicator-new` and its siblings change the marker
# character rather than the destination and stay permitted.
#
# So this looks at the operands git would actually receive, and refuses the
# two-operand form unless every operand resolves as a revision -- which is what
# separates `git diff main feature` from `git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key`.
# After a bare `--` no word can be a revision, so there the test is git's own:
# two or more words where any one lies outside the working tree. The write
# primitive needs none of that machinery: `--output` anywhere in a git
# invocation is refused outright.
#
# What it still cannot see, stated rather than implied: a command that builds
# its arguments at runtime (`git diff $x $y`, `sh -c ...`), one that changes
# directory out of the repository first, and anything a command reads or writes
# once it has started. This re-gates the pre-approved commands that reach past
# the deny list; it is not a sandbox.

  # subcommands accept the flag, and the subcommand this hook forgot is the
  # hole.
  # Brace expansion is the last rewrite bash performs that this scan can still
  # see, and it undoes both refusals below. It splits one word into several --
  # `git diff {/dev/null,./cosign.key}` is a single word here and two operands
  # to git, so the operand count never reaches 2 -- and it splits a flag name
  # apart -- `--outpu{t,t}=FILE` matches neither `--output` nor `--output=*`
  # here and arrives at git as `--output=FILE --output=FILE`. It needs no
  # variable and no subshell, so it is not one of the runtime-built arguments
  # this hook says it cannot see; it is plainly in the string and simply was
  # not expanded.
  #
  # Refused rather than expanded. Expanding means reimplementing bash's rules
  # in this hook -- nesting, `{1..9}` sequences, and the rule that a brace with
  # no comma and no range is a literal -- and a half-right expansion is a gate
  # that disagrees with the shell in some other direction. A refusal cannot be

  # command with a brace.
  #

  # argument this hook already cannot inspect -- refusing it is stricter than
  # the status quo, not weaker. A brace *before* the first `git` word is not
  # checked and does not need to be: the allow rules in .claude/settings.json
  # match a literal `git diff`/`git log` prefix, so a git invocation assembled
