#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse gate on the Bash tool.
#
# `.claude/settings.json` denies the Read tool this repository's secret-shaped
# paths -- the signing key, a .env, any private key -- and allows `git diff`,
# `git log`, `git show` and `git blame` with no prompt. Those are rules on
# different tools: a deny row on Read says nothing about what an allowed Bash
# command opens or writes, and this family of commands carries one primitive of
# each kind.
#
# The read primitive: `git diff` compares its operands as plain files rather
# than as repository content as soon as two operands are given and either one
# is not a revision, so it prints any file this uid can read -- untracked,
# gitignored, or outside the checkout entirely. Reading the signing key with
# the Read tool prompts; the diff form did not.
#
# Seven things this gate has to get right, each of them a spelling that a
# simpler check misses:
#
#   1. The mode has no required flag. `git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` prints
#      the file with no `--no-index` anywhere in the command, because git
#      enters that mode on its own once two operands are given. Matching the
#      flag string alone sees nothing.
#   2. The shell rewrites the command before git sees it. `--no-'index'` and
#      `--no-\index` both reach git as `--no-index` while a substring test on
#      the typed spelling finds neither.
#   3. `--` does not end the mode. `git diff -- /dev/null ./cosign.key` prints
#      the file: git's own scan (builtin/diff.c, cmd_diff) consumes a leading
#      `--` and then applies the same two-operand test to whatever follows.
#      Only an operand *before* the `--` stops that scan, which is why
#      `git diff HEAD -- path` can never be a plain-file read but
#      `git diff -- a b` can.
#   4. A lone `-` is an operand, not a flag. Git diff reads it as stdin and
#      counts it toward the same two-operand test, so `git diff /etc/shadow -`
#      prints the file. Skipping every dash-prefixed word -- which is right for
#      `--stat`, `-U0` and the rest, since git rejects an unknown one -- leaves
#      the operand count one short of the refusal.
#   5. Git decides inside-or-outside on the spelling, not on where the path
#      lands. `git diff -- ../<checkout>/cosign.key -` names a file inside this
#      repository by a route that leaves it and comes back; git calls that
#      outside and prints the file, while a test that folds `..` first sees a
#      tidy in-tree path and allows it. See `path_inside_worktree` below.
#   6. Bash expands braces before splitting words, so one word here can be two
#      words at git -- `git diff {/dev/null,./cosign.key}` -- and a flag name
#      split by a brace is no flag at all to a matcher working on the typed
#      spelling: `--outpu{t,t}=FILE` reaches git as `--output=FILE`. Both
#      refusals below are rebuilt by four characters. A brace bash would
#      expand is refused inside a git invocation rather than expanded; one
#      it would not -- git's own `HEAD@{1}`, `main@{upstream}` -- is left
#      alone. The brace test reads the words *as typed*, quotes and all:
#      `{a';',b}` is one word to bash and two paths after expansion, and a
#      test run on the quote-stripped words saw `{a` and `,b}` and passed
#      both. See `raw_words`, `brace_would_expand` and `BRACE_MSG`.
#   7. A git invocation ends where bash ends it, and only there. Every
#      unquoted `&` once counted as a command separator, so `git log 2>&1
#      --outpu{t,t}=FILE` closed the brace scope at the `&` of its
#      redirection and `git diff 2>&1 /dev/null ./cosign.key` reset the
#      operand count there; `>|` did the same as a pipe and `<(` as a
#      subshell. The split now reads redirections and process substitution
#      as bash does. See the split below `brace_would_expand`.
#
# The write primitive: `--output=FILE` sends the diff git would have printed to
# a path instead of stdout, so an allow-listed, unprompted call overwrites any
# file this uid can reach -- `cosign.pub`, which is the signature trust anchor
# committed here and copied into the image; `ci/inputs.lock.json`;
# `.claude/settings.json`; this hook; `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The deny rules
# are no help, because they gate the Read tool and say nothing about what an
# allowed Bash command writes. The operand scan below cannot see it either: it
# skips every dash-prefixed word, and it stops tracking git at the subcommand,
# while `git log -p --output=FILE` and `git show --output=FILE` are allow-listed
# and reach the same primitive. `git show` refuses the flag only for a
# *combined* diff -- a merge commit -- and writes an ordinary commit's diff in
# full, so "git show rejects --output" is not a reason to leave it out.
#
# The written content is diff-framed rather than byte-clean, which matters less
# than it sounds: the `+` lines carry whatever the caller committed, and for a
# trust anchor or a config file corruption alone is the event. Nothing
# legitimate needs the flag -- diff, log and show print to stdout, which the
# agent already reads -- so the refusal is the whole git invocation rather than
# one subcommand. `--output-indicator-new` and its siblings change the marker
# character rather than the destination and stay permitted.
#
# The shell has its own spelling of the same write, and it is the older one:
# `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub` truncates the file before git starts, and
# `>>`, `>|`, `&>`, `&>>`, `2>err`, `>&file` and `<>file` each open a path
# for writing the same way, wherever in the command they are written --
# `>cosign.pub git diff HEAD` is the same command as `git diff HEAD
# >cosign.pub`. Nothing in the allow rule sees it -- the rule
# matches a `git diff` prefix -- and the operand scan must not, because a
# redirection's target is the shell's word, not git's (counting it refused
# `git diff HEAD 2>&1`). So an output redirection inside a git invocation is
# refused outright, whatever it targets, on the same ground as `--output`:
# these commands print to stdout, and that is what to read. `>&N`, `N>&M`
# and `>&-` name a descriptor rather than a path and are not refused; nor is
# any input redirection (`<`, `<<`, `<<<`, `<&`); nor is a redirection on
# some other command of the same string that no allow rule covers
# (`echo x >out; git diff HEAD` is echo's own).
#
# The write primitive is not git's alone, and the rest of the allow list
# reaches it two ways. The shell spelling works on every one of them, because
# a rule ending in `:*` matches a command prefix while the redirection is the
# rest of the string: `python3 tests/run_tests.py >cosign.pub` truncates the
# trust anchor before a test is collected, and
# `gh run view 1 --log >.claude/settings.json` overwrites the file holding
# these rules. And `cosign verify`, alone among them, carries the flag
# spelling: `--output-file` is a *persistent* flag on cosign's root command,
# so every subcommand has it, and cosign creates and truncates the path
# before it verifies anything -- `cosign verify --output-file cosign.pub
# --key <key> <ref>` empties the anchor and then exits non-zero on a key it
# could not load. Both are refused for the commands named in
# `GATED_PREFIXES` below, which are the allow rows with a trailing `:*` other
# than git's. The two `ruff` rows are not among them and do not need to be:
# they carry no `:*`, so a redirection makes the string match neither row and
# Claude Code prompts, which is what `_note_ruff` narrowed them for.
#
# So this looks at the operands git would actually receive, and refuses the
# two-operand form unless every operand resolves as a revision -- which is what
# separates `git diff main feature` from `git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key`.
# After a bare `--` no word can be a revision, so there the test is git's own:
# two or more words where any one lies outside the working tree. The write
# primitive needs none of that machinery: `--output` anywhere in a git
# invocation is refused outright.
#
# One more rewrite sits between the typed word and the path git opens: an
# unquoted leading `~` is `$HOME` to bash and a literal `~` to a scan of the
# typed words, and `realpath -m -s` resolved that literal to `<checkout>/~/...`,
# an inside path. So `git diff -- ~/.aws/credentials ~/.bashrc` counted two
# operands, found both inside the working tree, and exited 0, and bash then
# handed git two files from the home directory, which it printed. A word of a
# git invocation that begins with an unquoted `~` (`~/...`, `~user/...`, `~`
# alone) is refused rather than expanded (see `TILDE_MSG`), and
# `path_inside_worktree` counts a leading `~` as outside as well, so the
# operand scan cannot be talked into the same answer by another route. A
# quoted or escaped tilde (`'~/x'`, `\~/x`) is a literal to bash and is not
# refused; nor is a tilde inside a word (`HEAD~1`). The containment test is
# stricter than that on purpose: it never resolves a leading `~` inside the
# tree, quoted or not, so two quoted tildes after a `--` (`git diff -- '~/x'
# '~/y'`) are refused as the plain-file form although bash would hand git two
# literal paths. Nothing here is named `~`, and the alternative is a
# containment test that has to know how each word was quoted.
#
# What it still cannot see, stated rather than implied: a command that hides a
# git invocation behind another interpreter (`sh -c ...`), one that changes
# directory out of the repository first, and anything a command reads or writes
# once it has started. A git argument built at runtime (`git diff $x $y`,
# `$(...)`, a backtick, `$'\x74'`) is no longer waved through -- every `$` and
# backtick in a word of a git invocation is refused, see `EXPAND_MSG` -- but
# that is a refusal, not an inspection. `xargs` is the one runtime reader
# refused by name: the words it reads from standard input (or from `-a FILE`)
# become operands of the command it runs, and Claude Code matches an allow
# row against `xargs <prefix>` as readily as against `<prefix>`, so
# `printf '%s\n' /dev/null ./cosign.key | xargs git diff` is the plain-file
# read of the key with no operand anywhere in the string (see `XARGS_MSG`).
# This re-gates the pre-approved commands that reach past the deny list; it is
# not a sandbox.

DIFF_MSG='blocked: this git diff would compare paths as plain files (git'"'"'s --no-index mode, which needs no flag once two operands are given), so it prints any file on disk -- the signing key, a .env, a private key outside this repository -- past the Read(...) deny rules in .claude/settings.json.

REDIRECT_MSG='blocked: an output redirection (>, >>, >|, &>, &>>, N>, >&FILE, <>) inside a git invocation makes the shell open its target for writing before git runs -- `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub` truncates the trust anchor, and `>> .claude/settings.json` or `2> .claude/hooks/gate-git-diff.sh` reach any file this uid can write -- and the allow rule for git diff, git log and git show sees none of it.

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the literal $G and $(...) are what the reader has to see
CMD_MSG='blocked: the name of a command in this string is not spelled literally -- it is built by an expansion (`$G diff ...`, `$(printf git) diff ...`, a backtick in command position), by a brace (`{,git} diff ...`), or by a glob (`g?t`, `/usr/bin/g[i]t`) -- so neither this gate nor the allow rule that matched the string'"'"'s literal prefix can tell which command bash will run, and `G=git; $G diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` runs the plain-file read this gate exists to refuse.

After a wrapper such as command, env, exec, timeout or xargs the same holds for every word of that command, since the wrapper'"'"'s own options are not modelled here. A literal name after an assignment is not what this rule refuses -- the assignment has a refusal of its own -- and a literal path to git (`/usr/bin/git diff`) is read as git. env -S (--split-string) splits a quoted string into a command this gate never sees and is refused outright.'

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the literal ${VAR} is what the reader has to see
BRACE_MSG='blocked: bash expands braces before git sees the words, and this gate reads the words as typed, so a brace rebuilds both spellings it refuses: `git diff {/dev/null,./cosign.key}` passes the operand scan as one word and reaches git as two operands (the plain-file read), and `--outpu{t,t}=FILE` matches no word here and reaches git as --output=FILE. Expanding braces correctly means reimplementing bash inside a hook, so a brace bash could expand -- a { followed, anywhere later in the word, by a comma or a .. and then a }, or a ${VAR} -- is refused instead, and so is a process substitution (`git diff <(...)`), which supplies an operand this gate never saw. Write the command out in full. A brace with neither, such as HEAD@{1} or main@{upstream}, is a literal to bash and is not refused; a .. between two reflog entries (HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{1}) has the refused shape, so write HEAD~2..HEAD~1.

GIT_GLOBAL_MSG='blocked: a git global option written before the subcommand reaches the same primitives from outside the part an allow rule matches. `-c diff.external=/tmp/evil` runs that program once per changed path -- the config spelling of GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF -- and `-c core.sshCommand`, `-c credential.helper` and `-c alias.x=!cmd` are the same shape; `--config-env` names an environment variable to take the value from; `-C <dir>` moves git to another directory, so `git -C /home/<user> diff -- .netrc .profile` printed a file outside this checkout while the containment test below resolved both operands inside it; and `--exec-path` is the value form of GIT_EXEC_PATH, which the environment rule refuses in every other spelling. So -c, -C, --config-env and --exec-path are refused between the name and the subcommand rather than stepped over. --git-dir, --work-tree, --namespace, --super-prefix and --attr-source only rename or relocate what git reports and are still stepped over.'

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the backticks quote command spellings for the reader
GLOB_MSG='blocked: bash expands a glob before git sees the words, so one word here is several operands at git and the operand scan never reaches the count it refuses at: `git diff /home/<user>/.ssh/*` is a single word to this gate and two operands to git, which prints the file. "A glob cannot leave the working directory" is no reason to expand it and check the result either, because the Read(...) deny rules this gate stands in front of name paths inside the checkout -- ./cosign.key, ./.env, **/*.pem. So a `*`, `?` or `[` bash would expand in a word of a git invocation is refused rather than expanded, for the reason the brace and $ rules give: expanding correctly means reimplementing bash in a hook.

# The shape of every brace expansion bash performs: a `{`, then a `,` or a
# `..` somewhere after it, then a `}` somewhere after that. Bash pairs a `{`
# with the last `}` it can, so `{a},b}` expands (to `a}` and `b}`) and a test
# that closed the brace at the first `}` missed the comma; no nesting or
# matching is tracked here, on purpose, and every refinement toward bash's
# real rule is a chance to disagree with it in some other direction. What
# this never does is call a word literal that bash would rewrite. Git's own
# `HEAD@{1}`, `main@{upstream}`, `@{-1}` and `@{2.days.ago}` have neither
# inside the braces and pass; so does a `{` that never closes, which bash
# leaves alone. `HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{1}` is refused although bash would not
# expand it -- the over-refusal is the safe direction, and BRACE_MSG names
# the `HEAD~2..HEAD~1` spelling. `${VAR}` is refused as well, as a
# runtime-built argument this hook cannot inspect.
#
# It is applied to the word as typed, quotes and backslashes included. A
# quoted comma or operator is still part of the word bash expands --
# `{a",",b}` and `{a';',b}` both become two words -- and a test on the

# through. A fully quoted `"{a,b}"`, which bash leaves alone, is refused as

# The command's words as bash would delimit them, split once and read by both
# scans below. Each word is kept in two spellings: as typed, with every quote
# mark and backslash in place, because bash brace-expands exactly that form
# and `brace_would_expand` has to see it; and with the quotes and backslashes
# removed, which is the word git receives and what the operand scan compares.
# Alongside them is what kind of thing each entry is: a `word` of a command, a
# `sep` (an unquoted command separator: `;`, `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `|&`, `(`,
# `)`, a newline, a backtick), or the `target` of a redirection.
#
# The separators are the only things that end a command, and the list has to
# be exactly bash's, in both directions. An earlier version of this split
# treated every unquoted `&` as a separator and reset the git scope at it, so
# `git log 2>&1 --outpu{t,t}=cosign.pub -1` passed: the `&` in `2>&1` closed
# the scope before the brace was seen, then bash expanded the flag and git
# overwrote the file. The same `&` reset the operand scan, and `git diff 2>&1
# /dev/null ./cosign.key` printed the key with neither operand counted. `>&`,
# `<&`, `&>` and `&>>` are redirections, and so is `>|` (the noclobber form),
# where the `|` is not a pipe. `|&` is a pipe and stays a separator. A `(`
# behind an unquoted `<` or `>` is a process substitution rather than a
# subshell: `git diff <(true) ./cosign.key` hands git a `/dev/fd/N` operand
# this scan never counted, so it is refused in a git invocation as an
# expanding brace is (see `raw_in_git` below) instead of resetting the scope
# at its `(`.
#
# A redirection is `[n]op word` -- an optional descriptor number written hard
# against the operator, one of `<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`, `<<<`, `<>`, `>&`, `<&`,
# `>|`, `&>`, `&>>`, and the target word. None of it is a word git receives:
# the number is dropped, the target is kept as `target` so that the operand
# scan can skip it, and the operator is kept beside the target in
# `redirects`, because which operator it was decides whether the shell opens
# the target for writing (see `redirection_writes_a_path`). `git diff HEAD
# 2>&1` is a one-operand diff; counting `2` and `1` refused it. A heredoc's
# body lines are read as words of the command that opened it, which can only
# over-refuse.
#

# Every scan below looks for a literal `git` word to open its scope, and the
# allow rules in .claude/settings.json match a literal `git diff`/`git log`
# prefix. Both are blind to a command whose *name* is not that word: in
# `git status; G=git; $G diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` the string is allowed
# on its `git status` prefix, `$G` is not the word `git`, so no scope opens
# and the hook exits 0 -- and bash runs the plain-file read (review on
# aurora-zfs-simple#205, the same hook). `$(printf git) diff ...` and a backtick in command position
# are the same thing spelled differently; so are `{,git} diff ...`, which
# bash brace-expands to `git`, and `g?t` or `/usr/bin/g[i]t`, which pathname
# expansion resolves to it; and so is the plain `/usr/bin/git diff ...`,
# which needs no expansion at all. Whether the permission layer would prompt
# for the second command on its own is not this gate's to assume.
#
# So the word that names each command has to be literal, and a literal path
# to git has to count as git. The name is the first word after a separator
# (or of the string) that is not a variable assignment (`FOO=bar git diff
# HEAD` names git) and not a shell keyword that takes a command (`{`, `!`,
# `if`, `then`, `time`, ...). After a wrapper that runs its arguments
# (`command`, `exec`, `env`, `nohup`, `noglob`, `xargs`, `timeout`, ...) the
# name is somewhere among the words that follow, behind options this gate
# does not model -- `command -- $G` -- so every remaining word of that
# command is held to the test. `noglob` is on that list because Claude Code
# steps over it before matching an allow row, so `noglob python3
# tests/run_tests.py >cosign.pub` matched the runner's row: zsh runs the
# command behind it, and bash, which has no `noglob`, opens the redirection
# before it reports the command missing, so the target is truncated either
# way. Each `xargs` stepped over is recorded as well, for the refusal in
# `check_gated_command` below. A word in that position carrying a `$`, a
# backtick, a `*` or `?`, a `[` (other than the `[` and `[[` commands
# themselves), or a brace bash would expand is refused, and so is an
# unquoted backtick opening there, whose output would be the name. A literal
# name whose last path component is `git` is rewritten to `git`, so
# `/usr/bin/git diff` opens every scope that `git diff` does. A
# redirection's target is never the
# name. One wrapper option is modelled, because it is not an option but an
# interpreter: `env -S 'git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key'` (GNU and uutils
# `--split-string`) splits its quoted string into a command this scan never
# sees as words, so any `-S`, clustered (`-iS`) or long, after `env` is
# refused outright. `sh -c ...` and `eval` remain the interpreters the
# header says this hook does not see behind.
#
# The cost is a backtick assignment (`X=\`date\``): the split ends the word
# `X=` at the backtick, and the backtick then opens in command position. The
# `$(...)` spelling of the same assignment is not affected. A glob or a `$`
# in an argument after a wrapper (`timeout 60 find . -name '*.sh'`) is

# From a `git` word to the end of *that command*: the scope opens at `git`

# the jq program alone while `git log -1; git diff {a,b}` and `echo x | git
# diff {a,b}` are each refused at their own `git`. A redirection does not
# close it: `git log 2>&1 --outpu{t,t}=FILE` is one command, and the brace
# in it is git's. This is narrower than the `in_git` latch below, which holds
# to the end of the string, and can be: that latch guards the `--output`
# test, which is kept wide on purpose. The word is compared with
# its quotes removed so `'git'` opens the scope as `git` does; a `git`
# assembled from an expansion (`g{i,i}t`) matches no allow rule and prompts on
# its own.
#
# The same scope decides the output redirections: bash attaches a redirection
# to the simple command it is written in, so `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub` is
# git's and `echo x >out; git diff HEAD` and `git diff HEAD | jq . >out` are
# not -- those are decided by whatever rule covers `echo` and `jq`, the way
# `git diff HEAD | tee cosign.pub` already is. Bash also lets a redirection
# *precede* the command name -- `>cosign.pub git diff HEAD` is the same
# command as `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub`, and `git status; >cosign.pub git
# diff HEAD` truncated the trust anchor while a scope that opened at the
# `git` word had not yet seen the target (review on arch-bootc#317). So a
# writing target seen before any `git` word of its command is carried until
# the command's name is known, and refused if that name turns out to be git;
# it is dropped at the next separator, so `>out echo x; git diff HEAD` is
# still echo's own, and it is taken only by a `git` the command-name scan
# above marked as naming its command, so `>out printf %s git` is printf's. A brace found anywhere in the string wins the refusal:
# an expanding brace means the words here are not the words git would
# receive, and that message is the one to act on first.
#
# The same scope refuses a word that begins with an unquoted `~`: bash
# expands it to `$HOME` before git runs, and the operand scan below, which
# reads the quote-stripped spelling, resolved the literal `~` inside the
# checkout and let `git diff -- ~/.aws/credentials ~/.bashrc` through. The

# The same write, reached by the allow-listed commands that are not git.
#
# Everything above is scoped to a `git` word, and the write primitive is not
# git's alone. `.claude/settings.json` allows twelve other command prefixes
# with a trailing `:*` -- "this command with any arguments" -- and an output
# redirection is part of the string that rule matches, so the shell opens the
# target before the command runs and nothing prompts:
# `python3 tests/run_tests.py >cosign.pub` truncates the trust anchor before a
# test is collected, and `gh run view 1 --log >.claude/settings.json`
# overwrites the file that holds these rules. The `Read(...)` deny rows gate
# the Read tool and say nothing about it, exactly as they say nothing about
# `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub`.
#
# One of those commands also carries the flag spelling. `--output-file` is a
# *persistent* flag on cosign's root command ("log output to a file"), so
# `cosign verify` has it, and cosign creates and truncates the path before it
# verifies anything: `cosign verify --output-file cosign.pub --key k <ref>`
# empties the trust anchor and then exits 1 on a key it could not load
# (observed with cosign v3.1.3). `_note_ruff` narrowed the two ruff rows to
# exact commands instead of a hook because every documented ruff invocation is
# a fixed string; cosign's is not -- the image reference is an argument -- so
# the rule keeps its `:*` and the refusal has to live here.
#
# The prefixes below are the allow rows with a trailing `:*` other than git's,
# which the scan above already covers. `Bash(ruff check)` and the full lint
# command are absent on purpose: they carry no `:*`, so a redirection makes
# the string match neither row and Claude Code prompts.
# `tests/test_git_diff_gate.py` derives this list from the settings file
# rather than restating it, so a rule added there fails here until it is

COSIGN_OUT_MSG='blocked: cosign --output-file FILE (and the = form) sends cosign output to the path it names, and cosign creates and truncates that path before it verifies anything, so `cosign verify --output-file cosign.pub --key cosign.pub <ref>` empties the trust anchor and then fails. It is a persistent flag on cosign root command, so every subcommand carries it, and Bash(cosign verify:*) approves the whole command line -- the image reference is an argument, so that rule cannot drop its trailing :* the way the ruff rows did. cosign prints to stdout; read that instead.'

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the literal ${VAR} and $(...) are what the reader has to see
COSIGN_EXPAND_MSG='blocked: a brace bash could expand, a $ or a backtick in a word of a cosign invocation is refused rather than expanded, for the reason BRACE_MSG and EXPAND_MSG give for git: bash rewrites the words before cosign sees them, so `--output-fil{e,e}=FILE` matches no flag spelling here and reaches cosign as --output-file=FILE, and $(...), ${VAR} and a backtick supply a word this gate never saw. Four characters rebuilt the git refusals twice this way. Write the command out in full.'

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the message quotes shell spellings as literal text
GATED_ENV_MSG='blocked: an assignment before a command (`NAME=value cmd ...`) is an environment the command runs under rather than a word of it, and for the commands this gate covers that environment changes what runs or where it goes. A git invocation carries both primitives refused elsewhere here: `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=prog git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` runs prog once per changed path, `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=diff.external GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=prog` reaches that same driver under another name, `PATH=dir git diff HEAD` runs a different git, and `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_INDEX_FILE` re-point the repository the operand scan was reasoning about -- each of them from a string the allow rows match on their `git diff` prefix. The other allow-listed families are the same: `GH_HOST=other gh pr list` and `GH_CONFIG_DIR=dir gh run view 1` send the token somewhere else. A deny list of variable names is the wrong shape for this, since it would have to track git'"'"'s own environment as git grows it. Run the command without the assignment.'

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the message quotes shell spellings as literal text
EXPORT_ENV_MSG='blocked: an assignment made by the export family (`export NAME=value`, `declare -x`, `typeset -x`, `readonly`) reaches a later command of the same string exactly as a leading `NAME=value` does, and this string arms one and then runs git or an allow-listed command: `export GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=prog; git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` runs prog once per changed path while no word of the git invocation carries an assignment at all. The builtin is refused rather than its options read, because the flag that exports has several spellings (-x, -gx, an earlier `declare -x NAME` with a plain `NAME=value` after it) and a half-modelled option list is a gate that disagrees with bash in some other direction. Only a string that also runs one of those commands is refused; an export on its own is not this gate'"'"'s business, and does not need to be -- a PreToolUse hook reads one command string, and Claude Code'"'"'s own permission matcher already holds every later command of that same string to its own allow rule, on every recognized separator (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `|&`, `&`, a newline): the export half of `git status; export FOO=1` prompts on its own account whether or not this gate says anything about it.'

# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the message quotes shell spellings as literal text
XARGS_MSG='blocked: xargs adds the words it reads from standard input (or from the file named by -a) to the command it runs, so the operands git or an allow-listed command receive are not in this string and nothing here can check them: `printf '"'"'%s\n'"'"' /dev/null ./cosign.key | xargs git diff` is the plain-file read of the key with no operand written anywhere, and `xargs cosign verify <args.txt` hands cosign an --output-file this gate never sees. The allow rule is no stop either: Claude Code matches Bash(git diff:*) against `xargs git diff` as readily as against `git diff`, so nothing prompts. So xargs is refused when the command it runs is git or one of the allow-listed prefixes, wherever it stands among the wrappers (`timeout 5 xargs git diff`, `xargs -a list.txt git diff`). Name the operands in the command itself instead. xargs in front of any other command (`git diff --name-only | xargs echo`) is not affected: it matches no allow row in .claude/settings.json, so it is left to the permission prompt.'

# disagrees with the shell in some other direction. A refusal cannot be
# half-right, and a git argument built at runtime was already outside what
# this hook can vouch for, so refusing it turns a silent pass into a visible
# refusal. Neither character has a literal form git relies on, the way
# `HEAD@{1}` relies on a brace, so unlike the brace test this one is every
# `$` and every backtick.
#
# The `$` half is scoped like the brace scan: to the words as typed of the
# command that starts at a `git` word and ends at the next separator bash
# honours, so `git diff HEAD | awk '{print $1}'` and `jq '.[$x]' f | git
# diff` are left alone while `git log -1; git diff $x` is refused at its
# own `git`. The words as typed are the right ones here as well: the
# normalized split cuts a *quoted* operator inside an argument, and a scope
# that closed there would hand `git log --grep='a|b' --outpu$'\x74'=FILE -1`
# its `$` word unwatched. A `$` *before* the first `git` word is not checked
# and does not need to be: the allow rules in .claude/settings.json match a
# literal `git diff`/`git log` prefix, so an invocation assembled out of an
