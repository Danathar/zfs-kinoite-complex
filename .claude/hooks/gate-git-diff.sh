#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse gate on the Bash tool.
#
# `.claude/settings.json` denies the Read tool this repository's secret-shaped
# paths -- the signing key, a .env, any private key -- and allows `git diff`,
# `git log`, `git show` and `git blame` with no prompt. Those are rules on
# different tools: a deny row on Read says nothing about what an allowed Bash
# command opens or writes, and this family of commands carries one primitive of
# each kind.
#
# The read primitive: `git diff` compares its operands as plain files rather
# than as repository content as soon as two operands are given and either one
# is not a revision, so it prints any file this uid can read -- untracked,
# gitignored, or outside the checkout entirely. Reading the signing key with
# the Read tool prompts; the diff form did not.
#
# Seven things this gate has to get right, each of them a spelling that a
# simpler check misses:
#
#   1. The mode has no required flag. `git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` prints
#      the file with no `--no-index` anywhere in the command, because git
#      enters that mode on its own once two operands are given. Matching the
#      flag string alone sees nothing.
#   2. The shell rewrites the command before git sees it. `--no-'index'` and
#      `--no-\index` both reach git as `--no-index` while a substring test on
#      the typed spelling finds neither.
#   3. `--` does not end the mode. `git diff -- /dev/null ./cosign.key` prints
#      the file: git's own scan (builtin/diff.c, cmd_diff) consumes a leading
#      `--` and then applies the same two-operand test to whatever follows.
#      Only an operand *before* the `--` stops that scan, which is why
#      `git diff HEAD -- path` can never be a plain-file read but
#      `git diff -- a b` can.
#   4. A lone `-` is an operand, not a flag. Git diff reads it as stdin and
#      counts it toward the same two-operand test, so `git diff /etc/shadow -`
#      prints the file. Skipping every dash-prefixed word -- which is right for
#      `--stat`, `-U0` and the rest, since git rejects an unknown one -- leaves
#      the operand count one short of the refusal.
#   5. Git decides inside-or-outside on the spelling, not on where the path
#      lands. `git diff -- ../<checkout>/cosign.key -` names a file inside this
#      repository by a route that leaves it and comes back; git calls that
#      outside and prints the file, while a test that folds `..` first sees a
#      tidy in-tree path and allows it. See `path_inside_worktree` below.
#   6. Bash expands braces before splitting words, so one word here can be two
#      words at git -- `git diff {/dev/null,./cosign.key}` -- and a flag name
#      split by a brace is no flag at all to a matcher working on the typed
#      spelling: `--outpu{t,t}=FILE` reaches git as `--output=FILE`. Both
#      refusals below are rebuilt by four characters. A brace bash would
#      expand is refused inside a git invocation rather than expanded; one
#      it would not -- git's own `HEAD@{1}`, `main@{upstream}` -- is left
#      alone. The brace test reads the words *as typed*, quotes and all:
#      `{a';',b}` is one word to bash and two paths after expansion, and a
#      test run on the quote-stripped words saw `{a` and `,b}` and passed
#      both. See `raw_words`, `brace_would_expand` and `BRACE_MSG`.
#   7. A git invocation ends where bash ends it, and only there. Every
#      unquoted `&` once counted as a command separator, so `git log 2>&1
#      --outpu{t,t}=FILE` closed the brace scope at the `&` of its
#      redirection and `git diff 2>&1 /dev/null ./cosign.key` reset the
#      operand count there; `>|` did the same as a pipe and `<(` as a
#      subshell. The split now reads redirections and process substitution
#      as bash does. See the split below `brace_would_expand`.
#
# The write primitive: `--output=FILE` sends the diff git would have printed to
# a path instead of stdout, so an allow-listed, unprompted call overwrites any
# file this uid can reach -- `cosign.pub`, which is the signature trust anchor
# committed here and copied into the image; `ci/inputs.lock.json`;
# `.claude/settings.json`; this hook; `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The deny rules
# are no help, because they gate the Read tool and say nothing about what an
# allowed Bash command writes. The operand scan below cannot see it either: it
# skips every dash-prefixed word, and it stops tracking git at the subcommand,
# while `git log -p --output=FILE` and `git show --output=FILE` are allow-listed
# and reach the same primitive. `git show` refuses the flag only for a
# *combined* diff -- a merge commit -- and writes an ordinary commit's diff in
# full, so "git show rejects --output" is not a reason to leave it out.
#
# The written content is diff-framed rather than byte-clean, which matters less
# than it sounds: the `+` lines carry whatever the caller committed, and for a
# trust anchor or a config file corruption alone is the event. Nothing
# legitimate needs the flag -- diff, log and show print to stdout, which the
# agent already reads -- so the refusal is the whole git invocation rather than
# one subcommand. `--output-indicator-new` and its siblings change the marker
# character rather than the destination and stay permitted.
#
# The shell has its own spelling of the same write, and it is the older one:
# `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub` truncates the file before git starts, and
# `>>`, `>|`, `&>`, `&>>`, `2>err`, `>&file` and `<>file` each open a path
# for writing the same way. Nothing in the allow rule sees it -- the rule
# matches a `git diff` prefix -- and the operand scan must not, because a
# redirection's target is the shell's word, not git's (counting it refused
# `git diff HEAD 2>&1`). So an output redirection inside a git invocation is
# refused outright, whatever it targets, on the same ground as `--output`:
# these commands print to stdout, and that is what to read. `>&N`, `N>&M`
# and `>&-` name a descriptor rather than a path and are not refused; nor is
# any input redirection (`<`, `<<`, `<<<`, `<&`); nor is a redirection on
# some other command of the same string (`echo x >out; git diff HEAD`).
#
# So this looks at the operands git would actually receive, and refuses the
# two-operand form unless every operand resolves as a revision -- which is what
# separates `git diff main feature` from `git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key`.
# After a bare `--` no word can be a revision, so there the test is git's own:
# two or more words where any one lies outside the working tree. The write
# primitive needs none of that machinery: `--output` anywhere in a git
# invocation is refused outright.
#
# What it still cannot see, stated rather than implied: a command that hides a
# git invocation behind another interpreter (`sh -c ...`), one that changes
# directory out of the repository first, and anything a command reads or writes
# once it has started. A git argument built at runtime (`git diff $x $y`,
# `$(...)`, a backtick, `$'\x74'`) is no longer waved through -- every `$` and
# backtick in a word of a git invocation is refused, see `EXPAND_MSG` -- but
# that is a refusal, not an inspection. This re-gates the pre-approved commands
# that reach past the deny list; it is not a sandbox.

# The shape of every brace expansion bash performs: a `{`, then a `,` or a

# with the last `}` it can, so `{a},b}` expands (to `a}` and `b}`) and a test
# that closed the brace at the first `}` missed the comma; no nesting or
# matching is tracked here, on purpose, and every refinement toward bash's
# real rule is a chance to disagree with it in some other direction. What
# this never does is call a word literal that bash would rewrite. Git's own
# `HEAD@{1}`, `main@{upstream}`, `@{-1}` and `@{2.days.ago}` have neither
# inside the braces and pass; so does a `{` that never closes, which bash
# leaves alone. `HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{1}` is refused although bash would not

# mark and backslash in place, because bash brace-expands exactly that form
# and `brace_would_expand` has to see it; and with the quotes and backslashes
# removed, which is the word git receives and what the operand scan compares.
# Alongside them is what kind of thing each entry is: a `word` of a command, a
# `sep` (an unquoted command separator: `;`, `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`, `|&`, `(`,
# `)`, a newline, a backtick), or the `target` of a redirection.
#
# The separators are the only things that end a command, and the list has to
# be exactly bash's, in both directions. An earlier version of this split
# treated every unquoted `&` as a separator and reset the git scope at it, so
# `git log 2>&1 --outpu{t,t}=cosign.pub -1` passed: the `&` in `2>&1` closed
# the scope before the brace was seen, then bash expanded the flag and git
# overwrote the file. The same `&` reset the operand scan, and `git diff 2>&1
# /dev/null ./cosign.key` printed the key with neither operand counted. `>&`,
# `<&`, `&>` and `&>>` are redirections, and so is `>|` (the noclobber form),
# where the `|` is not a pipe. `|&` is a pipe and stays a separator. A `(`
# behind an unquoted `<` or `>` is a process substitution rather than a
# subshell: `git diff <(true) ./cosign.key` hands git a `/dev/fd/N` operand

# expanding brace is (see `raw_in_git` below) instead of resetting the scope
# at its `(`.

# the number is dropped, the target is kept as `target` so that the operand
# scan can skip it, and the operator is kept beside the target in
# `redirects`, because which operator it was decides whether the shell opens
# the target for writing (see `redirection_writes_a_path`). `git diff HEAD
# 2>&1` is a one-operand diff; counting `2` and `1` refused it. A heredoc's
# body lines are read as words of the command that opened it, which can only
# over-refuse.
#

# Every scan below looks for a literal `git` word to open its scope, and the
# allow rules in .claude/settings.json match a literal `git diff`/`git log`
# prefix. Both are blind to a command whose *name* is not that word: in
# `git status; G=git; $G diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` the string is allowed
# on its `git status` prefix, `$G` is not the word `git`, so no scope opens
# and the hook exits 0 -- and bash runs the plain-file read (review on
# aurora-zfs-simple#205, the same hook). `$(printf git) diff ...` and a backtick in command position
# are the same thing spelled differently; so are `{,git} diff ...`, which
# bash brace-expands to `git`, and `g?t` or `/usr/bin/g[i]t`, which pathname
# expansion resolves to it; and so is the plain `/usr/bin/git diff ...`,
# which needs no expansion at all. Whether the permission layer would prompt
# for the second command on its own is not this gate's to assume.
#
# So the word that names each command has to be literal, and a literal path
# to git has to count as git. The name is the first word after a separator
# (or of the string) that is not a variable assignment (`FOO=bar git diff
# HEAD` names git) and not a shell keyword that takes a command (`{`, `!`,
# `if`, `then`, `time`, ...). After a wrapper that runs its arguments
# (`command`, `exec`, `env`, `nohup`, `xargs`, `timeout`, ...) the name is
# somewhere among the words that follow, behind options this gate does not
# model -- `command -- $G` -- so every remaining word of that command is
# held to the test. A word in that position carrying a `$`, a backtick, a
# `*` or `?`, a `[` (other than the `[` and `[[` commands themselves), or a
# brace bash would expand is refused, and so is an unquoted backtick opening
# there, whose output would be the name. A literal name whose last path
# component is `git` is rewritten to `git`, so `/usr/bin/git diff` opens
# every scope that `git diff` does. A redirection's target is never the
# name. One wrapper option is modelled, because it is not an option but an
# interpreter: `env -S 'git diff /dev/null ./cosign.key'` (GNU and uutils
# `--split-string`) splits its quoted string into a command this scan never
# sees as words, so any `-S`, clustered (`-iS`) or long, after `env` is
# refused outright. `sh -c ...` and `eval` remain the interpreters the
# header says this hook does not see behind.
#
# The cost is a backtick assignment (`X=\`date\``): the split ends the word
# `X=` at the backtick, and the backtick then opens in command position. The
# `$(...)` spelling of the same assignment is not affected. A glob or a `$`
# in an argument after a wrapper (`timeout 60 find . -name '*.sh'`) is

# Every test below reads a word as typed, and bash rewrites the words before

# the operand scan never counted, so `git diff $(echo /dev/null) ./cosign.key`

# `$'\x74'` is the letter t, so `--outpu$'\x74'=FILE` matches neither
# `--output` nor `--output=*` here and arrives at git as `--output=FILE`. The
# brace scan above catches a `${VAR}` and nothing else of this.
#
# They are refused rather than expanded, for the reason the brace scan gives:
# correct expansion means reimplementing bash in a hook -- nesting, quoting,
# word splitting on $IFS -- and a half-right expansion is a gate that
# disagrees with the shell in some other direction. A refusal cannot be
# half-right, and a git argument built at runtime was already outside what
# this hook can vouch for, so refusing it turns a silent pass into a visible
# refusal. Neither character has a literal form git relies on, the way
# `HEAD@{1}` relies on a brace, so unlike the brace test this one is every
# `$` and every backtick.
#
# The `$` half is scoped like the brace scan: to the words as typed of the
# command that starts at a `git` word and ends at the next separator bash
# honours, so `git diff HEAD | awk '{print $1}'` and `jq '.[$x]' f | git
# diff` are left alone while `git log -1; git diff $x` is refused at its
# own `git`. The words as typed are the right ones here as well: the
# normalized split cuts a *quoted* operator inside an argument, and a scope
# that closed there would hand `git log --grep='a|b' --outpu$'\x74'=FILE -1`
# its `$` word unwatched. A `$` *before* the first `git` word is not checked
# and does not need to be: the allow rules in .claude/settings.json match a
# literal `git diff`/`git log` prefix, so an invocation assembled out of an
# expansion (`$GIT diff ...`) matches no allow rule and prompts on its own.

  # `@{2.days.ago}` -- is spelled with exactly that literal form. Refusing it
  # blocks the ordinary diff against the previous commit for no gain, so the
  # test is `brace_would_expand`: a comma or `..` somewhere after a `{` and
  # before a `}`, which every expansion bash performs must have, and nothing
  # bash would leave alone needs. That test ran above, on the words as
