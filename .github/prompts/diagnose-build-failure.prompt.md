# Diagnose a failed build

**Goal:** name the cause with evidence, and say which fix applies.
**Not the goal:** make the build green by any means available.

A red run here is usually a fail-closed check doing exactly its job. Several of
the checks below have no "fix" in this repository at all — the correct outcome
is to stop and report what upstream did.

## 0. Did it fail, or was it cancelled?

```bash
gh run list --workflow build.yml --limit 10 --json createdAt,conclusion,event
```

The build badge shows the most recent *completed* run, and a **cancelled** run
renders as `failing` exactly like a real failure. `build.yml` sets
`cancel-in-progress: true`, so back-to-back merges to `main` each cancel the
run before them.

A column of `cancelled` with no `failure` is a *hypothesis*, not a conclusion.
Check the `event` and the timing before reporting it: `push` runs bunched a few
minutes apart are a merge burst, but `schedule` and `workflow_dispatch` runs can
also be cancelled, and `gh run cancel` means a person stopped the production
workflow on purpose. Reporting "someone was merging quickly" when an operator
cancelled a run deliberately buries the more interesting question.

## 1. Which workflow, and does it publish?

```bash
gh run list --limit 20 --json databaseId,name,event,conclusion,headBranch
```

`Build And Promote Main Image` (`build.yml`) is the only one that signs and
promotes `:latest`. `build-pr.yml` and `build-branch.yml` do not promote, and
`build-branch.yml` publishes unsigned. If the red run is one of those two,
nothing reached `:latest` and the urgency is lower — say so.

## 2. Find the step, not the job

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed | tail -60
```

Every workflow step that decides anything runs `python3 -m ci_tools.cli
<command>`, and a known refusal exits 1 with one line on stderr. That line is
the diagnosis. Read it before forming a theory.

## 3. Match the message to the guard

These are the fail-closed refusals. Each names a real condition, and the
response to each is different:

| The message says | What actually happened | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `does not provide a kmod-zfs for primary kernel <k> at ZFS version <v> even after a rebuild` | The akmods cache resolves its own OpenZFS version independently of this repo, and the two disagree. Continuing would label the image `org.zfs-kinoite-complex.zfs-version=<v>` while shipping something else. | Upstream problem. Establish whether the ZFS line supports that kernel yet. Do **not** loosen the match. |
| `Promoted digest mismatch: ... produced <a>, expected <b>` | `skopeo copy` did not preserve the digest. **The copy already happened** — `promote_stable.py` copies, then re-reads the destination — so if the destination named is `:latest`, the tag has already moved to the unexpected digest. | **Check which destination the message names.** For an audit tag, stop and investigate. For `:latest`, treat it as live: verify what `:latest` now resolves to, and restore the last known-good signed digest before investigating, because machines tracking it will pull whatever is there. Never bypass the guard itself. |
| `Failed to resolve digest for <ref>` / `Missing digest in skopeo inspect output for <ref>` | A registry read returned a manifest with no digest — usually a transient registry or CDN failure, sometimes a deleted tag. | Check whether the ref still exists. If it does, this is very likely transient (see step 4). |
| `SIGNING_SECRET is empty; cannot sign published image.` | The signing job ran without its secret, typically because the run came from a context that does not get one. | Confirm the trigger. A branch or fork run is not supposed to sign. |
| `Missing required verification key file: <path>` | `cosign.pub` is not where the signing or promotion step expects it. | A repository problem, not upstream. |
| `Replay lock file not found: <path>` | Replay mode was requested with no lock file. | See [`replay-a-build.prompt.md`](replay-a-build.prompt.md). |

## 4. Rule out a third-party service before proposing anything

Every workflow here pulls from quay.io, pushes to ghcr.io, and bootstraps
`cosign` from Sigstore. Any of the three can turn a run red with nothing wrong
in this repository, and all three shapes have been seen:

| Message | What happened |
| --- | --- |
| `happened during read: unexpected EOF` | A quay.io CDN blob transfer died mid-download. |
| `writing blob: … received unexpected HTTP status: 500` | ghcr.io server error on a layer upload. |
| `Error: trusted root is required when using new bundle format` | Sigstore's TUF CDN was unavailable — look for `failed to download https://tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev/…root.json, http status code: 403` just above it. |

**The third one is a trap, twice over.** It names a trusted root and a bundle
format, so it reads like a signing problem here. It is not — it fails while
*installing* `cosign`, not while using it.

But do not then conclude that nothing ran. `install-signing-tools` is invoked in
three separate `build.yml` jobs — `preflight`, `sign-akmods-cache` and
`promote-stable` — and again inside `publish-native-image`, which runs *after*
the transient image has been pushed. A 403 in `preflight`'s copy means almost
nothing happened; the same 403 in `promote-stable`'s means the candidate was
already built, signed and published. **Identify which job's installer failed
before describing the state of the run.**

For any of them: say so, name the job and the step, and note that a re-run is
the maintainer's call — this repo does not retry automatically, and a re-run of
`build.yml` publishes.

## 5. Distinguish "the pipeline is green" from "the image is good"

If you re-check after a re-run, say **which run** you read. A successful run
proves the build completed. It is not evidence the image is safe to boot
(AGENTS.md section 0 rule 4).

## 6. What the answer looks like

State, in this order:

1. Which run and which step, with the link.
2. The guard message, quoted.
3. Whether the run was cancelled rather than failed, or the cause is upstream,
   transient, or in this repository.
4. The fix — or that there is no fix here and what has to change upstream.

If item 3 is anything other than "in this repository", **stop there**. Proposing a code change
to get past a guard that is correctly refusing is the failure mode this
repository cares most about.
