# Replay a build

**Goal:** rebuild with the pinned inputs a past run used, so a difference in
behavior is attributable to something other than those inputs.

**This is a partial replay, not an exact one, and the difference matters.** The
lock file pins the base image, the build container and the ZFS version. It does
not pin the akmods source: `AKMODS_UPSTREAM_REF` is empty by default, so
`_resolve_default_akmods_ref()` resolves the tracked `main` ref afresh on every
run. If upstream advanced since the run you are reproducing, the replay builds
different source. Say so in the result rather than concluding from a
non-reproduction that the cause was not in the inputs.

Read this before starting: replay mode is reachable **only** from a manual
`workflow_dispatch`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` names it as the worked example of a path
covered by neither tier — it is an incident-reproduction tool, so a broken guard
in it surfaces exactly when someone needs it. Treat its refusals as
informative, not as obstacles.

## 1. Get the inputs of the run you are reproducing

Every run uploads a `build-inputs` artifact written by
`ci_tools/write_build_inputs_manifest.py`.

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --name "build-inputs-<run-id>"
cat build-inputs.json
```

The artifact name carries the run id (`build-inputs-${{ github.run_id }}` in
`.github/actions/prepare-main-akmods/action.yml`), so a bare `build-inputs`
will not resolve. `gh run view <run-id> --json ...` or the run page lists the
exact name if you are unsure.

The `inputs` object holds everything the lock file needs. If the artifact is
missing, the run predates it or failed before that step — say so rather than
reconstructing the values by hand from logs.

## 2. Fill in the lock file

`ci/inputs.lock.json` ships with `REPLACE_ME` placeholders. Copy from
`build-inputs.json`:

| Lock field | From `build-inputs.json` |
| --- | --- |
| `base_image` | `inputs.base_image_pinned` — the digest form, not the tag |
| `build_container` | `inputs.build_container_pinned` |
| `zfs_minor_version` | `inputs.zfs_minor_version` |
| `zfs_version` | `inputs.zfs_version` |

**`zfs_version` is the one people leave empty and should not.** Left empty, the
resolver re-resolves the newest release on `zfs_minor_version`, so once a newer
patch exists the replay does not reproduce the original ZFS version — and the
whole point was to hold the inputs still.

`akmods_upstream_ref` is deliberately not in the lock file. It comes from
`ci/defaults.json` so there is one source of truth.

## 3. Expect the build-container guard to fire

If `DEFAULT_BUILD_CONTAINER_IMAGE` in `ci/defaults.json` has moved since the run
you are replaying, `resolve_build_inputs` refuses with a message naming both
refs. That guard is correct: the container it would actually run in is not the
one the lock file names, so the replay would not be a replay.

The message tells you the resolution — set `DEFAULT_BUILD_CONTAINER_IMAGE` to
the locked ref *and* the matching literal in each workflow's `container:` block,
through a reviewed pull request. That container runs `--privileged` as root with
`/` mounted, which is why it cannot be overridden from a dispatch input.

Do not work around this by editing the lock file to match the current container.
That produces a green run that proves nothing.

**And be aware what the prescribed fix costs before proposing it.** Changing
`DEFAULT_BUILD_CONTAINER_IMAGE` in `ci/defaults.json` plus the workflow
`container:` literals is a change to `main`, and a push to `main` starts
`build.yml`. That run is not a `workflow_dispatch`, so the promotion condition is
satisfied and it will build, sign and move `:latest` using the *historical*
privileged container — before the diagnostic replay is ever dispatched. That is
a production change made in service of an investigation, and it needs an
explicit maintainer decision, not a step in a runbook.

## 4. Stop here if you are an agent

Everything above is preparation: read the artifact, fill in the lock, work out
whether the build-container guard will fire. **The dispatch itself is the
maintainer's.** It starts the production workflow, and AGENTS.md section 0 rule
6 puts that out of an agent's hands. Hand over the filled-in lock, the command
you would run, and the two hazards below.

## 5. For the maintainer: what dispatching actually costs

The lock file must be on the ref the run checks out. `gh workflow run` without
`--ref` runs the default branch's copy, which still has `REPLACE_ME` in
`ci/inputs.lock.json` — the run then fails in `resolve_build_inputs`. So the
populated lock has to be pushed somewhere the run can see it, and that push is
also yours to make.

**Two hazards before you dispatch on a branch:**

- **The signing environment.** `sign-akmods-cache` and `build-candidate-image`
  declare `environment: production-signing`.
  [`production-boundary-proposal.md`](../../docs/production-boundary-proposal.md)
  lists restricting that environment to `main` as a required setting, so where
  that restriction is in place a `replay/*` dispatch cannot reach the signing
  secret and the candidate build fails.
- **The shared cache moves first.** `build-zfs-akmods` runs before either
  signing job, and `build.yml` does not override `allow_cache_rebuild`, whose
  default is `true`. On a cache miss it republishes the shared
  `main-<fedora>` akmods tag — *before* the signing job is reached. So a
  branch dispatch can leave a rebuilt shared cache behind and then fail, which
  is the worst of both outcomes.

Given both, prefer replaying from `main` with a reviewed lock, or accept that a
branch replay is partial and may mutate the shared cache. Either way it is a
decision, not a runbook step.

```bash
gh workflow run build.yml \
  --ref replay/<what-you-are-investigating> \
  -f use_input_lock=true \
  -f lock_file=ci/inputs.lock.json \
  -f promote_to_stable=false
```

**`promote_to_stable=false` is not optional for a diagnostic replay.** The
default is `true`. A replay that promotes moves `:latest` to an image built for
diagnosis, which `bootc upgrade` then pulls onto whatever is tracking it.

**It does not make the replay read-only, though.** `promote_to_stable=false`
suppresses the promotion job and nothing else. `build.yml` calls
`prepare-main-akmods` without overriding `allow_cache_rebuild`, whose default is
`true`, so if the locked kernel and ZFS inputs do not match what the shared cache
currently holds, the replay **rebuilds and republishes the shared
`main-<fedora>` akmods tag** before building its candidate. That is a production
supply-chain input, replaced by a run you were treating as diagnostic. Check
whether a rebuild would be triggered before dispatching, and get explicit
authorization if it would.

## 6. Report

Say which run you replayed, which inputs the lock held, whether the replay
reproduced the behavior, and — explicitly — whether you promoted. If the replay
did **not** reproduce it, that is a finding: the cause was not in the inputs.
