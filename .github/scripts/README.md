# Workflow Command Map

The workflows in this repo call Python through one shared command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint:

- `python3 -m ci_tools.cli <command>`

That CLI dispatches to the real implementation in [`ci_tools/`](../../ci_tools).
This keeps the workflow files focused on job order, permissions, and data flow.

If a term is unfamiliar, check the shared glossary first:
[`docs/glossary.md`](../../docs/glossary.md)

### Akmods Failure Classification

`classify-akmods-failure` reads `artifacts/akmods-build.log` after the shared
ZFS akmods build fails. It writes `artifacts/akmods-failure.json` for the
sticky-issue workflow and appends a short GitHub step summary when
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is available.

The classifier is intentionally small and fail-closed:

- `upstream-compat` means the log matched a known ZFS/kernel compatibility
  surface. The build still fails, and image promotion remains blocked.
- `unknown` means the log did not match a known compatibility pattern and needs
  manual investigation.

For OpenZFS configure output, the classifier also compares `ZFS_META_KVER_MAX`
with the resolved `KERNEL_RELEASE`. If the base image kernel is newer than the
OpenZFS-declared maximum, the payload explains that the build is intentionally
failing closed until OpenZFS supports that kernel line.

## Workflow Map

- [`build.yml`](../workflows/build.yml)
  - main candidate build, promotion, and signing
  - scheduled runs are gated on the upstream base image advancing (`check-stable-signal`); push and manual runs always build
- [`build-branch.yml`](../workflows/build-branch.yml)
  - branch-tagged push using shared-cache reuse or rebuild when required
  - bot-authored runs stop after local validation and do not push/sign public branch tags
- [`build-pr.yml`](../workflows/build-pr.yml)
  - no-push validation build
- [`test.yml`](../workflows/test.yml)
  - Python unit tests (`pytest`) and `ruff check` for the CI tool modules
- [`akmods-failure-triage.yml`](../workflows/akmods-failure-triage.yml)
  - runs after `build.yml` completes via `workflow_run` trigger
  - opens or updates a sticky GitHub issue on classified akmods failures
  - auto-closes sticky issues when the next build succeeds

## Local Workflow Actions

These composite actions keep the workflow files focused on job order and data flow:

- [`load-ci-defaults`](../actions/load-ci-defaults/action.yml)
  - exports values from `ci/defaults.json`
- [`prepare-main-akmods`](../actions/prepare-main-akmods/action.yml)
  - resolves main-workflow inputs, uploads the build-input manifest, verifies shared akmods cache state, rebuilds the shared cache only when required, and exports the digest-pinned cache image
- [`prepare-registry-context`](../actions/prepare-registry-context/action.yml)
  - computes lowercase GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) paths and whether the current account is an automation bot
- [`build-native-image`](../actions/build-native-image/action.yml)
  - wraps the standard buildah invocation and build arguments for this repo
- [`prepare-rechunk-host`](../actions/prepare-rechunk-host/action.yml)
  - frees runner disk space, installs a podman version that preserves Chunkah's layer annotations, and relocates container storage onto the runner's larger disk, ahead of a build that will be rechunked
- [`rechunk-native-image`](../actions/rechunk-native-image/action.yml)
  - re-layers a locally built image into content-addressed chunks with Chunkah, in place, before it is pushed or signed
- [`install-signing-tools`](../actions/install-signing-tools/action.yml)
  - installs `skopeo` and `cosign`
- [`publish-native-image`](../actions/publish-native-image/action.yml)
  - requires `SIGNING_SECRET`, logs in to GHCR, pushes one tag, and signs the pushed digest
