# GEMINI.md

Behavioral guidelines adapted from `CLAUDE.md` for Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

Source basis: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills

Intent: make goals, constraints, and verification explicit so the model stays precise and avoids speculative edits.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward correctness and explicitness over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 0. This repository publishes a real image

This is not a sandbox. This repository is testing-only today — see `docs/safety-model.md`
— but the pipeline is real: it publishes a signed `:latest` tag that `bootc upgrade` pulls
onto whatever machine is tracking it, and there is no staging tier between a change landing
here and that machine booting it. Anyone who forks or tracks this repo, now or later, could
point real hardware with real ZFS pools at it. The bar for changes here is higher than
"tests pass," and these constraints override sections 1-5 below when they conflict:

- **Never weaken a fail-closed check to make something pass.** This codebase deliberately
  fails the build when ZFS does not match the primary kernel, when a signature cannot be
  verified, when a digest does not match, or when the akmods cache does not cover the
  required kernel and ZFS line. Fix the underlying cause or stop and report it — do not
  relax the check, add a fallback, or make it best-effort.
- **Treat the build, promotion, and signing path as safety-critical**: `build.yml`,
  `.github/actions/publish-native-image`, `ci_tools/sign_image.py`,
  `ci_tools/promote_stable.py`, `ci_tools/check_akmods_cache.py`,
  `containerfiles/zfs-akmods/install_zfs_from_akmods_cache.py`, and
  `files/scripts/configure_signing_policy.py`. State explicitly what could reach a booted
  machine if a change to one of these is wrong.
- **Verify claims against reality, not memory or docs.** Docs here have drifted from the
  code before. Read the code, check a real CI run's log, or inspect the actual published
  artifact before asserting how something behaves. If you cannot verify a claim, say so.
- **A green pipeline is not a safe image.** A successful run proves the build completed,
  not that the result is safe to boot. State which one you actually checked.
- **ZFS changes carry data-loss risk.** Anything touching the ZFS version, the kernel it
  is built against, or pool-facing behavior must consider rollback: an image that
  activates newer pool features can make the previous image unable to import those pools.
  Surface that risk; never quietly bump a ZFS line.
- **Do not push, promote, tag, or delete published artifacts on your own initiative.**
  Registry tags and git history here are outward-facing. Propose; let the maintainer decide.
- **When unsure whether something is risky, stop and ask.** An interrupted task is cheap
  here; a bad published image is not.

## Preferred Task Shape

For non-trivial work, anchor the response around this structure:

```text
Goal: [what success looks like]
Constraints: [what must not change]
Assumptions: [only if they matter]
Plan:
1. [step] -> verify: [check]
2. [step] -> verify: [check]
Result: [what changed / what remains]
```

If the task is simple, compress the format, but keep the same thinking.

## 1. Clarify Before Coding

**Resolve ambiguity early. Do not improvise on unclear requirements.**

Before implementing:
- Restate the request in concrete terms.
- State assumptions that affect behavior, file scope, or user-visible output.
- If multiple reasonable interpretations would lead to different code, surface them instead of silently choosing one.
- If the requested solution seems heavier than necessary, say so and propose the simpler path.
- If something important is unclear, stop and ask a focused question.

## 2. Prefer the Smallest Correct Change

**Solve the asked problem with the least code and the fewest touched files.**

- Do not add features, flags, abstractions, or future-proofing that were not requested.
- Prefer existing helpers and established patterns over new layers.
- Match the repository's current style, naming, and structure.
- Keep diffs reviewable. Every changed line should map back to the user's request.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer call this overbuilt for the problem?" If yes, simplify it.

## 3. Edit Surgically

**Preserve surrounding behavior unless the task explicitly says otherwise.**

When editing existing code:
- Do not refactor adjacent code just because you noticed it.
- Do not reformat files unnecessarily.
- Remove only the unused code created by your own change.
- Mention unrelated issues you notice, but do not fix them opportunistically.

When touching tests:
- Prefer the narrowest test that proves the requested behavior.
- Do not rewrite test structure unless it is required for the fix.

## 4. Make Success Verifiable

**Turn requests into checks you can run.**

Examples:
- "Fix the bug" -> reproduce it, change the code, re-run the reproducer.
- "Add validation" -> add tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
- "Refactor X" -> confirm behavior stays the same before and after.

Before finishing:
- Run the smallest meaningful verification available.
- If you could not verify, say exactly why.
- Call out remaining assumptions or risk briefly.

## 5. Report Outcomes Explicitly

**End with outcome, verification, and any unresolved risk.**

A good closeout usually includes:
- what changed
- what was verified
- what was not verified
- anything still uncertain

---

**These guidelines are working if:** diffs stay small, assumptions are visible, verification is concrete, and follow-up corrections decrease.
