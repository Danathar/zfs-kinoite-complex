## Why This Repo Exists

Fedora-family images move kernels quickly, and ZFS is an out-of-tree kernel module — so a new
Fedora kernel can land before a matching OpenZFS release exists. Build that carelessly and you
publish a Fedora Kinoite image whose kernel and ZFS modules do not match.

This repository builds a signed Fedora Kinoite image with ZFS userspace and kernel modules installed
from a self-hosted akmods cache image (a container image holding prebuilt ZFS kernel-module
packages), Distrobox from Fedora Kinoite, Homebrew from the `ublue-os/brew` payload, and a single-repository
signing policy for signed `bootc upgrade`. It deliberately stays close to standard tooling: one
`Containerfile`, direct `buildah`/Open Container Initiative (OCI) build arguments, one image
repository (`ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex`), and one shared akmods cache repository
(`ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex-akmods`).

OpenZFS is not hand-pinned to a patch version. Each build resolves the newest stable release in
a configured minor line (`ZFS_MINOR_VERSION`, `2.4` by default — see
[`ci/defaults.json`](./ci/defaults.json)) from
[OpenZFS's own GitHub releases](https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases) at build time, and that
is the version it attempts to build and install.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Changing this repository is a safety-sensitive change, not a demonstration.** A bad build can
> break a booted test machine and put pooled data at risk, so the build, promotion, and signing
> paths are held to a high standard — understand the blast radius before changing them. AI agents
> working here must read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) first.

> [!NOTE]
> Developed with significant AI assistance. For a simpler, more direct approach to the same
> problem, see [`aurora-zfs-simple`](https://github.com/Danathar/aurora-zfs-simple) — the minimal
> expression of the same idea. This repo carries the fuller pipeline: candidate-first promotion,
> input pinning, digest resolution, shared akmods caching, image signing, and unit tests
> throughout.

## Install

> [!WARNING]
> **This repository is testing-only. Unlike `zfs-aurora-complex`, it is not used
> in production.** Anyone forking this repository or using its artifacts should
> treat them as test artifacts, use a disposable VM, disposable pool, or
> dedicated test hardware, and evaluate the risks for their own environment.
> The author exercises it in VMs and intends to keep the image building and
> testing as the pipeline evolves. CI does not boot the image or import a pool
> before `:latest` moves; promotion proves composition, signing, and `bootc
> container lint`, not production runtime safety. See
> [`docs/safety-model.md`](./docs/safety-model.md).

```bash
sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex:latest
sudo systemctl reboot
```

`--enforce-container-sigpolicy` is required on the first switch, not optional --
it records the deployment as policy-verified instead of as an unverified
registry image. Afterwards, `sudo bootc upgrade` is the normal path.

Full steps, post-boot validation commands, and manual signature verification:
[`docs/install-and-verify.md`](./docs/install-and-verify.md).

The CDDL/GPLv2 position on redistributing a binary ZFS module is recorded in
[`docs/licensing.md`](./docs/licensing.md). It is not legal advice; read it
before redistributing this image or basing a downstream image on it.
