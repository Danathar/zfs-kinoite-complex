# Script: build_files/build-image.sh
# What: Applies all image customizations in one place during the native build.
# Doing: Enables brew services, installs cached ZFS RPMs, writes the in-image
#        signing policy, and cleans up build-only state.
# Why: A separate build script is easier to read than one large Containerfile
#      shell block, and it keeps the teaching comments close to the steps.
# Goal: Produce one bootable Fedora Kinoite image with ZFS, Fedora defaults,
#       brew, and repository trust configuration.

# Build-time configuration is passed from the Containerfile as environment
# variables so the script can stay reusable in GitHub Actions workflow runs and local tests.

# CI passes the exact image today, while local builds usually rely on the

# `bootc container lint` expects package-created state directories under `/var`

# Remove build-only runtime state before `bootc container lint` runs.
# Why these paths are safe to drop:
# 1. `/run` is runtime-only state and should not be baked into the image.
# 2. `/var/lib/containers` here came from build-time image inspection, not from
#    something users need at runtime after deployment.
# 3. Some builders leave resolver files bind-mounted under `/run/systemd`.
#    Those specific paths can be busy, so cleanup here must be best-effort
#    instead of failing the entire image build on a harmless leftover mount.
# The `|| true` guards below are intentional:
# - `/run/systemd/resolve` may be an active bind mount that cannot be unmounted
#   during this build step, so the umount attempt is best-effort.
# - `2>/dev/null` on the find commands suppresses errors when a directory has
#   already been removed by an earlier `-exec` in the same invocation.

# Drop the cache and lock state `dnf5` leaves behind after the ZFS install
# above. Both currently show up as `bootc container lint` warnings:
# - `/run/dnf` trips `nonempty-run-tmp`. `/run` is a tmpfs on a booted system,
#   so anything baked in here is masked at boot and is pure image weight.
# - `/var/lib/dnf` trips `var-tmpfiles`. Content baked into `/var` is only
#   applied at initial install and is never refreshed by a later
#   `bootc upgrade`, so build-time cache has no business being there: every
#   machine installed from the image would carry this run's stale copy forever.
# Neither path holds anything the booted system needs. Installed-package state
# lives in the rpm database under `/usr`, and dnf's versionlock configuration
# lives in `/etc/dnf`; dnf recreates its own cache directories on demand.
rm -rf /run/dnf /var/lib/dnf

# No explicit `ostree container commit` here: `bootc container lint` (run next,
# in the Containerfile) already performs the equivalent validation/finalization.
# bootc's current Fedora Atomic templates use the same lint/finalization model;
# no separate ostree container commit is needed here.
