"""
Script: ci_tools/check_akmods_cache.py
What: Checks whether the shared akmods cache can be reused for the current primary base-image kernel.
Doing: Pins and pulls the cache image, checks for a matching `kmod-zfs` RPM and a valid
cosign signature, then writes cache state outputs.
Why: Skip rebuild when safe, but rebuild when the required primary-kernel module set is
missing, older than the current target kernel, or not signed by this repo's own key.
Goal: Control rebuild decisions in main and validation workflows.
