"""
Script: ci_tools/check_stable_signal.py
What: Decides whether the scheduled production workflow should build.
Doing: Compares the current upstream stable-signal digest, and the current
resolved ZFS patch version, against what is recorded on this repo's latest
promoted image.
Why: Scheduled runs should only spend build time when Kinoite stable has
advanced OR a new OpenZFS patch is available on the configured minor line --
otherwise a patch release (including a security fix) could sit unbuilt
indefinitely while the base image itself stayed still.
Goal: Fail closed on unknown upstream state and skip only truly unchanged
scheduled runs.
