    Yield a directory holding a `config.json` carrying `creds`, or `""`.

    This is how a registry credential reaches `skopeo` and `cosign` without
    ever appearing in a command line. `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is mode 0444, so a
    token passed as `--creds` or `--registry-password` is readable by *every*
    uid on the runner for as long as the child lives. A `0600` file in a
    per-call temporary directory narrows that to the uid that created it, for
    the duration of one command. That is what gotcha 6 in
    `docs/signing-and-bootc.md` ("do not pass registry secrets in command
    argv") asks for.

    What this deliberately does not claim is protection from a hostile process
    running as the *same* uid in this job. Such a process can read the
    auth-file path out of argv and open the file -- but it does not need to:
    the credential reaches these helpers as `REGISTRY_TOKEN` in the calling
    step's environment (`.github/actions/prepare-main-akmods/action.yml`), and
    `/proc/<pid>/environ` is mode 0400, i.e. readable by that same uid. No
    credential-transfer mechanism available inside a job fixes that; the
    job-level `docker/login-action` alternative is weaker on this exact axis,
    since `docker login` leaves the token in `~/.docker/config.json` for the
    whole job instead of one command. What changes here is the cross-uid
    exposure, which was real and is now gone.

    One directory serves both tools because both read the ordinary
    Docker/containers auth format: `skopeo` takes the file path through
    `--authfile` / `--src-authfile` / `--dest-authfile`, and `cosign` reads
    `config.json` out of the directory named by `DOCKER_CONFIG`. Verified
    against real binaries -- skopeo 1.22.2, cosign v3.1.3 (one patch ahead of
    the v3.1.2 `install-signing-tools` pins, same release line) and the cosign
    v2.4.1 preinstalled in the akmods build container -- run against this
    repo's own signed akmods image, including the negative case:
    a deliberately wrong credential in the file produces a registry denial
    rather than a silent fall back to an anonymous pull, so the file is
    demonstrably the thing being used.

    Yields `""` when `creds` is empty, so the anonymous callers keep their
    exact current behavior: no flag, no `DOCKER_CONFIG` override, and
    therefore whatever `docker/login-action` already left in the job.

    Raises `CiToolError` when `creds` is given but no reference names a
    registry. Writing `{"auths": {}}` there would yield a truthy directory, so
    the caller would still point `--authfile` / `DOCKER_CONFIG` at a file
    carrying no credential and the command would run anonymously with the
    credential silently unused -- the same failure mode a public package hides
    from every positive check. A caller in that state has a bug; say so.

    """
    Verify a cosign signature on one image reference against a public key file.

    Raises `CiToolError` (via `run_cmd`) if verification fails for any reason:
    no signature found, wrong key, or a registry/network error. Callers that
    want "not signed" to mean "treat as unusable, do not consume" should catch
    `CiToolError` around this call rather than letting it propagate.

    Deliberately does not pass `--new-bundle-format=false`, unlike
    `sign_image.py`'s sign step. This function runs in more than one
    environment -- including cosign v2.4.1, preinstalled in the
    `ghcr.io/ublue-os/devcontainer` akmods build container, which does not
    recognize that flag at all -- so it must work the same way everywhere.
    Verified directly: both cosign v2.4.1 and v3.1.2 correctly verify this
    repo's actual signed images (produced by `sign_image.py` with
    `--new-bundle-format=false --use-signing-config=false
    --registry-referrers-mode=legacy`) using a bare `cosign verify --key ...`
    with no format flag, and both correctly fail (nonzero exit, "no signatures
    found") against an actually-unsigned image.

    `creds` is the same `actor:token` pair the skopeo helpers take. When a
    caller supplies it, it is written to a `0600` auth file and pointed at with
    `DOCKER_CONFIG`, not passed as `--registry-username`/`--registry-password`;
    see `registry_auth_dir` for why, and for the versions this was verified
    against. The env override is scoped to this one command, so a job that
    authenticated with `docker/login-action` and calls this without credentials
    still resolves them from its own Docker config exactly as before.
