"""
Script: ci_tools/promote_stable.py
What: Promotes the tested candidate tag to stable tags in the same image repository.
Doing: Refuses when a newer run already promoted, then copies the candidate digest to one
immutable audit tag, then to `latest`.
Why: Candidate-first promotion keeps broken builds from advancing the normal user-facing tag.
Goal: Update stable tags without rebuilding the image a second time.

    Refuse to promote when a newer run has already promoted.

    Every promotion writes `stable-<run>-<sha7>` before it moves `latest`, so
    the highest run number among those tags is the newest build that reached
    users. Re-running an old, finished run keeps that run's
    `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`, and the in-progress `concurrency` cancel in
    `build.yml` does not stop it. Without this check such a re-run would move
    `latest` back to an older image, and an older image may be unable to
    import pools whose features a newer one enabled (`docs/SECURITY-AI.md`).

    An equal run number is allowed: that is a re-run of the same build, which
    resolves the same candidate. A deliberate rollback is a new dispatch,
    which gets a new, higher run number.

    `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` counts per workflow. If promotion ever moves to a
    workflow whose count is lower than the existing `stable-*` tags, this check
    refuses every promotion until those tags are removed. That is the
