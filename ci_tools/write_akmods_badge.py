"""
Script: ci_tools/write_akmods_badge.py
What: Builds a shields.io endpoint-badge JSON payload reflecting OpenZFS/kernel compat state.
Doing: Reads the build workflow's conclusion and (when present) the akmods failure payload,
    then writes a small JSON file in shields.io's dynamic-badge schema.
Why: The README badge should show the specific reason a build is blocked (not just red/green),
    without duplicating the parsing already done in classify_akmods_failure.py.
Goal: Give a reader glancing at the README the same answer the sticky issue already has.

    Return a shields.io endpoint-badge payload, or None when the badge should be left alone.

    Only two states are ever rendered: a classified upstream-compat failure (red, with the
    specific versions involved), and a successful build (green). Any other conclusion
    (unclassified failure, cancelled run, etc.) is not this badge's concern, since it does not
    tell us anything new about OpenZFS/kernel compatibility.

    `build_ran` distinguishes a real build from a scheduled run the stable-signal gate skipped.
    A skipped run still reports conclusion "success", but it never touched OpenZFS or the
    kernel, so it must not overwrite a previously red badge with "in sync" -- that would hide
    a real, still-unfixed incompatibility behind a run that proved nothing. The failure branch
    below does not need its own `build_ran` check: a classified failure payload can only exist
    if the akmods build step actually ran, which the workflow always uploads the
    `build-inputs-<run_id>` artifact for earlier in the same job, so `build_ran` is already
    true whenever `failure_payload` is present.
