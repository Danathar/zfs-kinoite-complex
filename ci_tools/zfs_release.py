"""
Script: ci_tools/zfs_release.py
What: Resolves the newest published OpenZFS release on one configured minor line.
Doing: Queries the OpenZFS GitHub releases API and picks the highest patch number
whose (major, minor) matches the requested line exactly.
Why: OpenZFS ships maintenance releases for several minor lines in one batch (for
example zfs-2.4.3, zfs-2.3.8, and zfs-2.2.10 have been published within seconds
of each other). Trusting API result order, or matching by string prefix across
lines, can select an older line's release that merely happened to publish
later -- silently downgrading ZFS. Filtering to the exact requested line before
comparing patch numbers makes that impossible.
Goal: Give both the scheduled-build gate and the akmods cache-reuse check one
trustworthy answer to "what is the newest release on this line right now".

    Paginates rather than reading only the API's default first page. One page

    recent release pushed past a single page by newer releases on other lines.

    silently settle for an older patch that happened to fall inside the window.
