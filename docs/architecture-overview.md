# zfs-kinoite-complex Architecture Overview

If a term is unfamiliar, check the shared glossary first:
[`docs/glossary.md`](./glossary.md)

## Purpose

This project provides a controlled way to run ZFS on Kinoite with a native
`Containerfile` build.

The technical target is still the same:

1. track the moving Kinoite/Fedora kernel stream
2. build matching ZFS akmods, meaning the ZFS kernel-module packages built for that exact kernel set
3. install those RPMs (Red Hat Package Manager package files) into the final image
4. publish stable tags only after candidate succeeds

## Real Simplification Goals

This repository intentionally keeps three things out of the image build flow:

1. no generated recipe layer
2. no separate candidate image repository
3. no branch/candidate akmods alias repository flow

That means the main complexity now lives in two places only:

1. input pinning and akmods cache control in `ci_tools/`
2. image-build-time ZFS install logic in `containerfiles/zfs-akmods/install_zfs_from_akmods_cache.py`

One smaller cleanup also matters for readability:

- repo-owned data-shaping logic now lives in tracked Python helpers instead of
  inline workflow shell wherever that tradeoff is reasonable

## Outputs

### OS Image Repository

All operating-system image tags live in the same repository:

- candidate tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex:candidate-<sha>-<fedora>`
- stable tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex:latest`
- stable audit tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex:stable-<run>-<sha>`
- branch tag: `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex:br-<branch>-<fedora>`

### Shared Akmods Cache Repository

The shared cache remains separate because it is a different kind of build output:

- `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex-akmods:main-<fedora>`
- `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex-akmods:main-<fedora>-x86_64`

Workflow jobs still check or publish the readable `main-<fedora>` tag, but the
final OS image build consumes that cache by digest:

- `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex-akmods@sha256:<digest>`

Why keep a separate akmods cache repository:

1. it keeps the final OS image tags readable
2. it preserves the existing akmods reuse model
3. the cache is build-time infrastructure, not the user-facing OS image

## How It Works

### 0. Scheduled-Build Gate

Before anything else runs, the `preflight` job in `build.yml` decides whether
a scheduled run should build at all. Push and manual (`workflow_dispatch`)
runs always build; only the daily `schedule` trigger is gated. This logic
lives in [`ci_tools/check_stable_signal.py`](../ci_tools/check_stable_signal.py).

The upstream `STABLE_SIGNAL_IMAGE` (`quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops/kinoite:45` by
default; see [`ci/defaults.json`](../ci/defaults.json)) is treated as the
authoritative cadence signal for "has the upstream base image moved since we
last published?"

`STABLE_SIGNAL_IMAGE` should name the same upstream image as
`DEFAULT_BASE_IMAGE`. The gate is only meaningful when the image it watches is
the image the build actually consumes. Keep these two values pointed at the
same Fedora Kinoite major tag.

Both default to the explicit Fedora major tag `kinoite:45`, deliberately.
The major tag follows the supported Fedora Kinoite stream without silently
switching to a development or rawhide stream. If the supported Fedora major
changes, update both defaults and validate the corresponding akmods support
before promotion.

That tradeoff is the point: this image exists to carry ZFS, and a ZFS module
built against a kernel OpenZFS declines to support is a worse outcome than
temporarily staying on the previous Fedora major.

This repo's own `:latest` image only carries provenance: every
build writes three OCI labels onto the candidate (and promotion carries them
onto `:latest`):

- `org.zfs-kinoite-complex.stable-signal-image`: which upstream image was used as the signal
- `org.zfs-kinoite-complex.stable-signal-digest`: that image's digest at build time
- `org.zfs-kinoite-complex.zfs-version`: the exact OpenZFS patch version this build resolved and installed

The gate compares the current upstream digest against the base-image signal
labels, AND independently compares the newest release on the configured ZFS
minor line (see [`ci_tools/zfs_release.py`](../ci_tools/zfs_release.py)) against
the `zfs-version` label, so a scheduled run builds when *either* one has moved.
Without the second check, a new OpenZFS patch release -- including a security
fix -- could sit unbuilt indefinitely as long as the Kinoite base image itself
did not change, because the base-image digest is all the gate used to compare.
It returns one of:

| Reason | Meaning | Builds? |
|---|---|---|
| `stable-signal-unchanged` | current `:latest` already reflects this exact upstream digest AND ZFS version | no |
| `stable-signal-advanced` | upstream digest moved since the last promoted image | yes |
| `zfs-version-advanced` | a newer OpenZFS release exists on the configured minor line | yes |
| `stable-signal-image-changed` | `STABLE_SIGNAL_IMAGE` itself was reconfigured since the last promotion | yes |
| `current-latest-missing` | no `:latest` has ever been published | yes |
| `current-latest-missing-stable-signal-labels` | `:latest` exists but predates this gate, or was built by a non-schedule event before provenance was recorded | yes |
| `current-latest-missing-zfs-version-label` | `:latest` exists but predates the `zfs-version` label | yes |
| `not-schedule-event` | push or manual run; the gate is bypassed entirely | yes |

The `zfs-version` label baked onto the image is *not* sourced from this gate's
own resolution, unlike the stable-signal labels. It comes from the real
`build-zfs-akmods` job's own resolution -- the same value the akmods
cache-reuse check validated against and the same one actually installed --
so the label can never claim a version different from what the image really
carries.

The gate is fail-closed on unknown state: a registry error while checking the
upstream signal image always raises and fails the job. A registry error while
checking the repo's own `:latest` (auth failure, rate limit, network blip) is
treated the same way, *except* for a genuine "tag does not exist" response,
which is a normal `current-latest-missing` build reason. The point is that
"we couldn't tell" must never be silently treated as "nothing changed." The
same applies to the OpenZFS releases API call: a network failure or an
unparseable response raises and fails the job rather than silently falling
back to "no ZFS change detected."

Push and manual runs still resolve and record the current upstream
stable-signal digest (best-effort; a registry hiccup does not fail the build)
so the *next* scheduled run has fresh provenance to compare against. Without
this, a push build would leave the label empty, and the following scheduled
run would always see `current-latest-missing-stable-signal-labels` and do a
full rebuild even when the upstream base image had not moved. The `zfs-version`
label does not need this same bootstrapping step: it is always written by the
real `build-zfs-akmods` job for every event type, schedule included, so it is
never left empty by a push or manual run the way an unresolved stable-signal
digest would be.

The `akmods-failure-triage.yml` workflow (see "Operational Model" below)
checks for a `build-inputs-<run_id>` artifact before treating a run as a real
build. A gate-skipped scheduled run reports `success` but never reaches input
resolution, so it never uploads that artifact — this keeps a skipped run from
being mistaken for a green build and auto-closing sticky failure issues that
track a still-unfixed problem.

### 1. Input Resolution

The main workflow resolves and pins:

1. base image ref, digest, and stable tag
2. build container ref and digest for the akmods job
3. Fedora major version
4. every installed kernel found in `/lib/modules`
5. resolved akmods source commit SHA
6. ZFS minor version line

Those values are written to a saved workflow output file named `build-inputs-<run_id>` so the same input set can be replayed later.

The `main` workflow now wraps that whole preparation path in one local action:

- [`.github/actions/prepare-main-akmods/action.yml`](../.github/actions/prepare-main-akmods/action.yml)

That action does five things in one place:

1. resolve and record build inputs
2. upload the build-input manifest
3. verify whether the shared akmods cache can be reused
4. rebuild and republish the shared cache only when required
5. resolve the checked or rebuilt cache tag to the digest-pinned ref passed to the final image build

### 2. Shared Akmods Cache Reuse Or Rebuild

The workflow checks whether the shared cache image already contains a matching
`kmod-zfs-<kernel_release>-<zfs_version>-...rpm` for the supported primary
kernel **and** the exact OpenZFS patch version resolved for this run (see
[`ci_tools/zfs_release.py`](../ci_tools/zfs_release.py)), **and** that the
cache is signed by this repo's own cosign key. Matching on the minor line
alone (for example any `2.4.*`) used to let a cache built for an older patch
on that line silently satisfy a newer one, so a new OpenZFS patch release
never actually forced a rebuild as long as the kernel and line stayed the
same.

The repo's policy is:

1. detect every installed kernel in the base image for visibility
2. choose the newest detected kernel as the supported primary kernel
3. require ZFS support only for that supported primary kernel, at the exact resolved patch version
4. use image rollback, not older bundled kernels in the same image, as the recovery path

That check now does one direct inspection path:

1. copy the shared cache image into a local Open Container Initiative (OCI) layout
2. unpack its filesystem layers
3. check whether the extracted RPM tree contains a matching `kmod-zfs` package for the supported primary kernel at the exact resolved ZFS version
4. only once that matches, verify the cache image's cosign signature against
   the committed `cosign.pub` (see
   [`ci_tools/check_akmods_cache.py`](../ci_tools/check_akmods_cache.py)'s
   `cosign_verify` call)

The signature check exists because this cache is a real supply-chain input,
not just build-time infrastructure: branch workflows also hold `packages:
write` and can rebuild and republish this same shared tag, so a matching
filename alone does not prove who produced the content being reused. A cache
that matches the kernel and ZFS version but fails signature verification is
treated the same as a cache miss. Only `main` runs may rebuild and republish
this cache: branch runs pass `allow_cache_rebuild: "false"` and fail with an
explanation instead, because the signing key lives in a `main`-restricted
environment they cannot reach, so anything they published would be unsigned
and rejected by every later consumer anyway. When a `main` run does rebuild,
a dedicated `sign-akmods-cache` job (in `build.yml`, running in the
`production-signing` environment) signs the freshly published digest, reusing
`ci_tools/sign_image.py` unchanged.

One environment detail worth knowing: this signature check runs inside the
same `ghcr.io/ublue-os/devcontainer` container as the rest of the akmods job,
which ships its own preinstalled cosign (currently v2.4.1) rather than the
v3.1.2 this repo installs elsewhere via `install-signing-tools`. The
`cosign_verify` helper deliberately does not pass `--new-bundle-format=false`
(a flag v2.4.1 does not recognize at all) because both versions verify this
repo's legacy-format signatures correctly without it -- verified directly
against a real signed image before relying on it. `build-pr.yml`'s validation
job does not run inside that container, so it installs cosign explicitly via
`install-signing-tools` instead.

Even when the shared cache is reusable, the workflows still clone the resolved
`Danathar/akmods` commit once per run.

Why:

1. a stale akmods ref can hide for a while if the workflow keeps reusing an older shared cache
2. cloning the resolved ref is the cheapest way to prove that the configured commit SHA
   still exists in the configured fork
3. this keeps branch, pull request, push, and schedule paths honest with each other

The akmods source commit is chosen by a cascade (see [`docs/akmods-fork-maintenance.md`](./akmods-fork-maintenance.md)):

1. explicit env override (`AKMODS_UPSTREAM_REF`)
2. non-empty pin in `ci/defaults.json`
3. floating `AKMODS_UPSTREAM_TRACK` ref resolved via `git ls-remote` on every run

The default is (3), so the build self-heals once upstream catches up after a transient incompatibility.

If yes:

- reuse the cache

If no:

1. clone the resolved `Danathar/akmods` fork commit
2. point its target output to `ghcr.io/<owner>/zfs-kinoite-complex-akmods`
3. build the shared cache image for the supported primary kernel

Important design change:

- this repo no longer patches the cloned akmods `Justfile` at runtime
- the repo-specific publish-name logic now lives in the `Danathar/akmods`
  fork commit itself
- that keeps the runtime clone step boring: clone, check out the exact commit, verify the commit SHA, stop

Plain-language summary of how the akmods source is selected:

1. the source repository is still the configured fork, `Danathar/akmods`
2. `ci/defaults.json` *can* pin one exact commit via `AKMODS_UPSTREAM_REF`, but that
   field is **empty by default**, so the normal mode is floating: `AKMODS_UPSTREAM_TRACK`
   (default `main`) is resolved with `git ls-remote` at the start of every run
3. whichever commit that resolves to is then treated as fixed for the rest of the run —
   the workflow clones exactly that SHA into `/tmp/akmods` and verifies it
4. so pushing new commits to that fork **does** affect this repo without any edit here.
   The next run resolves the new SHA immediately; that new fork code only builds the
   shipped modules at the next akmods cache rebuild, since a reused cache is not rebuilt

See [`docs/akmods-fork-maintenance.md`](./akmods-fork-maintenance.md) for the full
resolution cascade, when to set a temporary pin, and the provenance caveat that follows
from point 4.

### 3. Native Final Image Build

The final image is defined by the repository root [`Containerfile`](../Containerfile).

It does four important things:

1. starts from the pinned `BASE_IMAGE`
2. imports Homebrew from the `ublue-os/brew` payload because Fedora Kinoite does not ship it
3. runs [`build_files/build-image.sh`](../build_files/build-image.sh)
4. runs `bootc container lint`

The buildah invocation uses Docker v2s2 manifest format (`oci: false`) rather than
OCI image manifests because host update tooling (`bootc upgrade` on booted
machines) works more reliably with the Docker format. The "OCI" terminology
elsewhere in this project refers to OCI standards for registry interaction and
layer handling, not the specific container image manifest format produced by
buildah.

`build-image.sh` then:

1. installs the committed `cosign.pub` public key into the image trust-material path
2. enables brew setup/update services via `systemctl preset`
3. keeps Distrobox from the upstream Fedora Kinoite image
4. runs the ZFS install helper against the resolved akmods cache image reference
5. writes repository-specific signing policy for `ghcr.io/danathar/zfs-kinoite-complex`
6. installs the local `tmpfiles.d` declaration needed for `bootc container lint`
7. removes build-only runtime/container state

There is no explicit `ostree container commit` step: the `RUN bootc container
lint` that follows performs the image validation/finalization needed by this
native bootc build, so a separate commit step is redundant.

For future Fedora package additions during image composition, use
`dnf5 -y install ...` in the container build. Distrobox does not need a local
install step here because Kinoite already includes it.

The signing-policy step is now a pure Python helper:

- [`files/scripts/configure_signing_policy.py`](../files/scripts/configure_signing_policy.py)

That removed the earlier shell script that embedded an inline Python block just
to write `policy.json`.

Fedora-version handling is intentionally dynamic here:

1. workflow runs normally pass a digest-pinned `AKMODS_IMAGE` build argument
2. local builds can rely on `AKMODS_IMAGE_TEMPLATE` instead
3. the helper fills in `{fedora}` by asking the selected base image which Fedora
   major version it is based on
4. that keeps the root `Containerfile` from hard-coding `43`, `44`, or any
   other future Fedora major version into its local-build fallback

#### Content-Based Layering With Chunkah

After `bootc container lint` passes, the workflow (not the `Containerfile`)
re-layers the locally built image with
[Chunkah](https://github.com/coreos/chunkah), meaning it re-splits the same
filesystem content into content-addressed layers instead of the layers
buildah produced. Chunkah does not add, remove, or change any file inside the
image; it only changes which layer each byte range lives in, so unrelated
future updates can reuse layers whose content has not changed instead of
re-pulling whole files that happen to share a layer with something that did
change.

This lives outside the `Containerfile` because it operates on the already-built
local image, between the build and the point where that image is pushed and
signed:

1. [`.github/actions/prepare-rechunk-host`](../.github/actions/prepare-rechunk-host/action.yml)
   runs at the top of each build job, before `build-native-image`, and prepares
   two things a default GitHub-hosted runner does not provide:
   - a version-matched `crun`/`buildah`/`podman`/`skopeo` set, installed
     unconditionally from Ubuntu's `resolute` apt suite; podman before 5
     silently drops Chunkah's layer annotations on push, which would defeat the
     whole point of rechunking. The install is unconditional on purpose. It
     and the step asserts podman `>= 5` after installing, so a regression in
     the suite fails the build instead of quietly producing an unannotated
     image.
   - container storage relocated onto the runner's larger `/mnt` disk, because
     rechunking briefly needs two unpacked copies of the image in storage at once
2. [`.github/actions/rechunk-native-image`](../.github/actions/rechunk-native-image/action.yml)
   runs after `build-native-image` and before `publish-native-image`. It rechunks
   the local image via `podman run --mount=type=image` against the Chunkah
   container, buffers the compressed result to an OCI archive on `/`, prunes all
   local container storage, then loads the archive with its temp directory
   pointed at `/mnt` -- so neither disk ever has to hold two unpacked copies of
   the image at once -- and finally re-tags the rechunked result back onto the
   same local tag `publish-native-image` expects.
3. `publish-native-image`'s promote step copies the signed digest to the
   requested tag with `skopeo copy --preserve-digests`, so that copy cannot
   silently re-encode the manifest and drop Chunkah's layer annotations.
   `ci_tools/promote_stable.py`'s later `latest`/audit-tag copies already used
   `--preserve-digests` for the same reason.

The Chunkah container image (currently `v0.6.0`) is both version- and
digest-pinned as the `chunkah_image` input default inside
`rechunk-native-image/action.yml`, tracked by a Renovate custom manager in the
root [`renovate.json`](../renovate.json) whose regex captures both
`currentValue` and `currentDigest`. It is digest-pinned, not just
version-pinned, because this step rewrites the locally built image
immediately before it is pushed and signed -- a moved tag under the same
`v0.6.0` version would let unreviewed content in right before this repo's own
key signs it. Renovate owns essentially every other version bump in this
repo, including the GitHub Actions commit-SHA pins used throughout
`.github/actions/` and `.github/workflows/`, the `ruff` version pinned for CI
linting, and the OpenZFS minor release line in
[`ci/defaults.json`](../ci/defaults.json).

There is one deliberate exception. `ublue-os/remove-unwanted-software` in
[`prepare-rechunk-host/action.yml`](../.github/actions/prepare-rechunk-host/action.yml)
is pinned to a commit that upstream has not tagged (it merges their "v10" work,
but their tags still stop at `v9`), so there is no released version for
Renovate to anchor to and it does not appear in the dependency dashboard.
Do not "fix" this by adding a `# v10` comment. No such tag exists, so Renovate
would not find the declared version in the registry at all. It would not
propose anything: rolling back to `v9` in that situation requires
`rollbackPrs`, which defaults to `false` and is not enabled by this repo's
presets, and there is no version above `v10` to offer either. The annotation
would therefore be silently inert *and* untrue — strictly worse than the
current honest absence, because a future reader would see a version comment
and reasonably assume the pin is tracked.

The pin is an immutable SHA, so nothing drifts; the only cost is not being told
when upstream finally tags a release. Revisit when they do — at that point the
correct fix is to repin to the tagged commit and add the matching comment,
not to annotate the existing SHA.

### 4. Primary-Kernel ZFS Install Logic

This repo no longer tries to keep every bundled kernel inside the current image
ZFS-ready.

Instead, the helper does this:

1. inspect every kernel directory under `/lib/modules`
2. choose the newest detected kernel as the supported primary kernel
3. require one matching `kmod-zfs` RPM for that kernel
4. install ZFS userspace RPMs and that one primary `kmod-zfs` through `dnf5`
5. run `depmod -a <kernel>` for the supported primary kernel
6. fail the build if that supported kernel does not end up with a `zfs.ko` module (the check accepts uncompressed `zfs.ko` as well as Fedora's compressed forms `zfs.ko.xz` and `zfs.ko.zst`)

Why this is the chosen tradeoff:

1. the intended safety rule is "do not publish a new image unless the kernel it is expected to boot first has working ZFS"
2. if a deployed image still proves bad, the recovery path is rollback to the previous image
3. that makes support for older bundled kernels inside the current image optional rather than required
4. dropping that broader guarantee removes a large amount of build and compose complexity

Consequence:

- if the current image contains an older bundled kernel and someone boots that older kernel directly, ZFS is not guaranteed to work there
- the documented recovery path is to roll back the image instead

### Retired Design Note: The Older Multi-Kernel Fallback System

Earlier versions of this project used a more complex design.

That older design worked like this:

1. inspect every detected kernel in the base image
2. build kernel-module payloads for every detected kernel
3. merge those payloads back into one shared akmods cache image
4. install one `kmod-zfs` package normally through `rpm-ostree`
5. unpack the remaining kernel-module payloads directly into the image root
6. run `depmod` for every detected kernel

Why it existed:

1. some upstream base images exposed more than one installed kernel under `/lib/modules`
2. the older design tried to guarantee that ZFS would still work even if someone booted an older bundled kernel from the current image
3. that was a stronger guarantee than simple image rollback

Why this repo no longer uses that design:

1. the stated operator goal is simpler: do not publish a new image unless the primary kernel has matching ZFS support
2. if a deployed image still proves bad, the documented answer is to roll back to the previous image and stay there
3. once rollback became the chosen recovery model, supporting every bundled kernel inside the current image stopped being necessary
4. most of the remaining pipeline complexity lived in that broader guarantee

What was intentionally given up:

1. booting an older bundled kernel from the current image is no longer treated as a supported ZFS recovery path
2. the supported recovery path is now image rollback to the previous known-good image

### 5. Promotion And Signing

Publication signs the candidate digest before any user-facing tag is moved.

The publish action:

1. pushes a transient `*-unsigned-<run_id>` tag
2. resolves that transient tag to a digest
3. signs and verifies that digest
4. copies the signed digest to the requested candidate tag

Promotion is a separate job.

It:

1. resolves the candidate tag digest
2. re-verifies that digest's cosign signature against the committed `cosign.pub`
3. copies that digest to `stable-<run>-<sha>` (the immutable audit tag)
4. copies that digest to `latest`

Step 2 is deliberately redundant with the signing that already happened during
candidate publication. Promotion runs as a separate job on a fresh runner, and
it is the step that actually points `latest` at a digest, so it verifies
locally rather than inferring from an earlier job that the digest it is about
to promote is signed. It verifies with the same committed public key that is
baked into the image and enforced by booted systems, so a key mismatch or a
missing signature fails in CI instead of at a user's next `bootc upgrade`. If
verification fails, neither tag moves.

Audit-before-`latest` is deliberate: `build.yml` cancels an in-progress
promotion when a newer push starts a fresh run (see the workflow's
`concurrency` block), so if the job is cancelled between the two copies, an
audit record with no `latest` move is a safer partial state than a moved
`latest` with no audit record. Each copy uses skopeo's `--preserve-digests`
and `--multi-arch=all`, and is followed by inspecting the destination tag to
confirm it resolved to the exact candidate digest — this keeps the copy
fail-closed if a future manifest-list image or a change in skopeo's
conversion behavior would otherwise change the digest silently.

It does not sign `latest` again. Cosign signatures are tied to the digest, so
the candidate signature carries over when `latest` resolves to the same digest.

Because candidate and stable tags are in the same repository, the trust model is simpler:

- no second image path under `ghcr.io`
- no stable-vs-candidate policy drift
- no host-side repair script to normalize two repository names

The signer uses legacy cosign registry attachments because the bootc policy path
used here discovers signatures through containers/image
`use-sigstore-attachments`. See
[`docs/signing-and-bootc.md`](./signing-and-bootc.md) for the detailed signing
model and the cosign v3 compatibility flags.

## Operational Model

1. `build.yml`: candidate-first build and promotion
   - the workflow now uses small Python helpers for registry-context export and
     candidate-tag generation instead of inline shell snippets
   - scheduled runs are gated on the upstream base image advancing; see "0. Scheduled-Build
     Gate" above. Push and manual runs always build
2. `build-branch.yml`: branch-tagged push with shared-cache reuse only
   - branch runs never rebuild the shared akmods cache and never sign anything;
     the signing key is scoped to a `main`-only environment
   - bot-authored branch runs build locally and intentionally skip the push
   - human-authored branch runs push an UNSIGNED `br-*` test image (explicit
     `allow_unsigned` opt-in in `publish-native-image`) for throwaway VMs only;
     machines enforcing this repository's signature policy refuse those tags
   - the final branch image tag is now composed by a small Python helper
3. `build-pr.yml`: read-only validation inputs plus no-push build
4. `test.yml`: Python unit tests for repository-owned CI helpers and image-build helpers
5. `akmods-failure-triage.yml`: `workflow_run` visibility workflow that opens, updates, and closes sticky akmods failure issues
   - failed shared-akmods builds upload `akmods-failure.json` before the job exits
   - `upstream-compat` marks known ZFS/kernel compatibility failures; the build
     still fails and `latest` is not promoted
   - when OpenZFS configure metadata shows `ZFS_META_KVER_MAX` below the
     resolved base-image kernel, the job summary and sticky payload call out
     that this is an intentional fail-closed protection

## Design Principles

1. keep stable on the last known-good build when candidate fails
2. keep the final image repo single-path and boring
3. keep the shared akmods cache explicit and inspectable
4. pin run inputs so `latest` drift does not change behavior mid-run
5. keep the supported-kernel logic in Python, not inline workflow shell
6. keep workflow defaults in one checked-in file instead of copying them across YAML files

One unavoidable exception exists:

- GitHub resolves `jobs.<job>.container.image` before any step can run
- because of that, the akmods jobs in both `build.yml` and `build-branch.yml`
  still carry one literal fallback build-container ref next to the checked-in
  defaults file
- both workflows accept a `workflow_dispatch` input to override this fallback
  when the default image breaks
- every later step reads the checked-in defaults instead of repeating them
