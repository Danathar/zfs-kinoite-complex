"""
Module: shared/kernel_release.py
What: Shared helpers for comparing Fedora kernel release strings.
Doing: Builds one natural-sort key used by both CI input resolution and the
image-build helper.
Why: The repo chooses a single supported primary kernel in more than one place,
so the sort logic should live in one module instead of drifting.
Goal: Keep primary-kernel selection consistent across workflow and build paths.
