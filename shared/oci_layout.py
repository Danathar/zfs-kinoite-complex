"""
Module: shared/oci_layout.py
What: Shared helpers for reading and unpacking local OCI layout directories.
Doing: Reads `manifest.json`, resolves layer tarball paths, and unpacks those
files after checking that archive members stay inside the target directory.
Why: Both CI cache inspection and the image build unpack OCI layers. Keeping
that logic in one module avoids drift between two implementations.
Goal: Make OCI-layer inspection easier to read and maintain.

    Reject members that could escape the extraction destination.

    Why: these helpers unpack under a temporary working directory, so archive
    members should never escape it. An attacker-controlled layer could ship a
    symlink or hardlink whose `name` is safe but whose `linkname` points out of
    the destination, so the link target is validated too.

    Note: `extractall(..., filter='data')` below is the load-bearing security
    check (Python 3.12+ rejects the same unsafe cases and more). This explicit
    pre-scan exists to produce a clearer error message with the offending
    member name before the extractor runs.
