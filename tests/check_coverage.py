Script: tests/check_coverage.py
What: Enforces the per-module coverage floors recorded in .coverage-thresholds.json.
Doing: Reads the coverage.json produced by the test run and compares each module's covered-statement count against its floor.
Why: A repository-wide percentage is the wrong gate here -- CONTRIBUTING says the number moving is not a finding, and one well-tested module can hide another that stopped being exercised at all.
Goal: Make a test that stops reaching a module fail on the pull request that stops it, without ever blocking a change on a percentage.

Deliberately not a --cov-fail-under gate. Three reasons, in order:

1. A percentage moves when code is added, so it punishes growth. A covered-line
   count only falls when a test stops reaching lines that used to run.
2. A single repository-wide number lets one module's coverage mask another's.
   The floors are per module for exactly the reason arch-bootc's are: a
   well-tested helper cannot hide a regression that stops a shipped module from
   being exercised.
3. CONTRIBUTING is explicit that the percentage itself is not a finding. This
   does not change that. Nothing here reads or asserts a percentage; the
   percentages printed alongside each result are context for a reader, not the
   thing being gated.

Floors are raise-only by convention, and raising is never automatic. Raising a
floor is evidenced by an absence being closed -- the suite demonstrably reached
those lines. Lowering one is evidenced by an absence, and a deleted test and a
deliberately removed code path look identical from the count alone. So lowering
a floor stays a decision a person makes in a diff, with a reason in the commit.

The floors only ever cover what `--cov` measures, which left a hole: a file that
ships and executes but sits outside those paths had no entry anywhere, so it was
neither measured nor recorded as deliberately unmeasured. `Containerfile` and
`build_files/build-image.sh` are exactly that -- they run only inside an image
build, so nothing on the host reaches them.

So the manifest has a second section. Every tracked `*.py`, `*.sh` and
`Containerfile` outside `tests/` must appear in `floors` (measured, with a
number) or in `unmeasured` (with a reason). Adding a shipped file and nothing
else turns the gate red, which is the point: the choice gets made once, in the
open, instead of drifting. This is the idea aurora-zfs-simple's
tests/test-coverage.sh gates -- assert a decision, not a number -- combined with
arch-bootc's per-file floors.

The two sections are mutually exclusive and both are checked in both directions:
a file in `unmeasured` that coverage *did* measure is an error, because it
should carry a floor instead.

Run by .github/workflows/test.yml. Also runnable by hand:

    python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=ci_tools --cov=shared \\
      --cov=containerfiles/zfs-akmods --cov=files/scripts \\
      --cov-branch --cov-report=json
    python3 tests/check_coverage.py
