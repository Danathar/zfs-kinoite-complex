"""
Script: tests/run_tests.py
What: Runs this repository's test suite, refusing any selection that would import Python from outside tests/.
Doing: Rejects the pytest options that move collection off this tree, import a module by name or write to a path they name, resolves every positional selection inside tests/, requires every file Python or pytest could load from the checkout to be tracked by git, then execs pytest.
Why: `.claude/settings.json` has to allow *some* test command unattended, and an unrestricted one is unbounded local code execution -- pytest imports every module it collects, and an import is not a tool call, so nothing in the deny list is consulted.
Goal: Make the one command an agent may run without a prompt able to import only code that is already in the diff.

The problem this exists for, stated plainly. `.claude/settings.json` denies
`cosign sign`, `skopeo copy`, `podman push`, `gh release`, `gh pr merge` and
the rest because `docs/SECURITY-AI.md` says those operations are outward-facing
and irreversible. Those rules decide *commands*. A Python module that runs

    subprocess.run(["cosign", "sign", ...])

at import time is not a command the agent asked to run, so no rule sees it. A
test runner imports every module it collects. So an allow-listed
`python3 -m pytest <anything>` is a way to reach every denied operation with
one approved command, and the deny list is only as strong as the set of files
that runner is willing to import.

What this closes and what it does not, because the difference is the whole
point:

  * **Closed:** code from outside this repository. `pytest /tmp/x.py`,
    `--pyargs some.installed.module`, `-p some_plugin` and
    `--confcutdir=/` each import something that was never in a diff and that
    no reviewer will ever see. Those are refused outright, in every spelling
    pytest accepts -- including `-o addopts=...`, which splices whatever it
    is given into the command line after this script has looked at it.
  * **Closed:** the options that write. pytest can send a report, a log or a
    debug trace to a path the caller names, and `--basetemp` empties the
    directory it is given. An allow-listed command carrying one of those
    overwrites `cosign.pub`, `.claude/settings.json` or the git gate beside it,
    with no `Read(...)` deny row in the way -- those gate the Read tool -- and
    no prefix rule able to see a flag in the middle of an ordinary command.
    That is the write half of the primitive `.claude/hooks/gate-git-diff.sh`
    refuses for `git`; see `REFUSED_WRITE_OPTIONS`.
  * **Closed:** a file dropped into the checkout and not committed. Checking
    only the `*.py` under a selection was not enough, because pytest and
    Python load code from further afield: `python3 -m pytest` puts the
    repository root first on `sys.path`, so an untracked root `pytest.py` *is*
    pytest; pytest puts `tests/` first too, so an untracked `tests/ci_tools.py`
    shadows the real package for a test that names one file; `test*.txt` under
    `tests/` is collected as a doctest; and a `tests/pytest.ini` sets `addopts`
    exactly as the refused `-o` would. So every untracked `*.py`, `*.pyc` and
    `*.so` anywhere in the checkout, every untracked file under `tests/`, and
    every untracked pytest or coverage config file at the root is refused --
    see `untracked_loadable_files`. Staging it is a separate step that shows
    up in `git status` and in the pull request.
  * **Closed:** the options that import a module by name. `-W ignore::mod.W`
    imports `mod` to resolve the warning category, `--pdbcls=mod:Cls` imports
    `mod`, and `--cov-config` names an rc file whose `plugins =` imports and
    whose `data_file =` writes. Each is refused with the import options.
  * **Closed:** an argument file. pytest's parser is built with
    `fromfile_prefix_chars="@"`, so `@PATH` anywhere in argv is replaced by
    the lines of PATH *inside pytest*, after this script has looked at the
    one word it was given. A file holding `--junitxml=cosign.pub` or
    `/tmp/elsewhere_test.py` carried every refusal above past the checks
    below, and `@.env` printed the file's first line in pytest's
    "file or directory not found" error without writing anything. Any
    argument starting with `@` is refused; see `ARGUMENT_FILE_PREFIX`.
  * **Not closed:** a hand-built `__pycache__/*.pyc` whose header matches a
    tracked source's size and mtime. Python prefers it over the source, but
    making one takes a binary write timed to the source, and a byte-code cache
    is not something this script can tell from the one the last run left.
  * **Not closed:** a *tracked* file under `tests/`. Agents are invited to add
    tests here -- `docs/SECURITY-AI.md` lists editing tests as something an
    agent may do unattended -- so a committed test module runs by design. The
    control for that one is review, not this script, and
    `docs/SECURITY-AI.md` says so rather than implying otherwise.

A committed manifest of test files was the alternative, matching
`build_files/brew-payload.manifest`. It was not taken: it would be a second
hand-maintained copy of the `tests/` file list, churned by every pull request
that adds a test, and it would gate a file the same agent may edit in the same
commit. Asking git which files are tracked gets the drop-in property for free
and cannot drift from the tree.

Standard library only, like everything else that runs before pytest is
installed. When pytest is absent this falls back to
`python3 -m unittest discover`, which CONTRIBUTING documents as the
no-network path -- with the caveat that `unittest discover` does not recurse
into `tests/e2e/` the way pytest does, so the fallback runs fewer tests and
says so.

Run it the way the permission rule spells it, from the repository root:

    python3 tests/run_tests.py                 # the whole suite
    python3 tests/run_tests.py tests/test_cli.py -v

# Options that move collection, conftest discovery or plugin loading off this
# tree. Each is refused rather than sanitised: an option that can name an

# recognise, and refusing is legible in a way a rewritten argv is not.
#
# `--pyargs` turns positional arguments into module names, which would bypass
# the path check below entirely. `-p` loads a plugin module by name from
# sys.path. `--confcutdir` is the upward bound on conftest.py collection, so a
# value above the repository root pulls in a conftest nobody here wrote.
# `--rootdir` and `-c`/`--config-file` relocate what pytest considers the
# project, which moves both of those in turn. `-o`/`--override-ini` sets any
# ini option for the run, and one of those is `addopts`, whose value pytest
# splices into the command line before it parses options -- so
# `-o addopts=--pyargs x` is `--pyargs x` with an allowed option wrapped
# around it. Refused whole: there is no ini key worth telling apart.
# `-W`/`--pythonwarnings` imports the module of a dotted warning category
# (`-W ignore::mod.W` runs `mod`), and `--pdbcls=mod:Cls` imports `mod` for the
# debugger. `--cov-config` names a coverage rc file, whose `plugins =` imports

# rule cannot see a flag in the middle of an otherwise ordinary command --
# which is the same pair of sentences `_note_git_diff_gate` makes about

#
# `--junitxml` (and its `--junit-xml` alias) overwrites the path with the XML
# report. `--log-file` truncates it. `--debug` replaces it with pytest's trace
