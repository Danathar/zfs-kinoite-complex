"""
Script: tests/test_action_build_native_image.py
What: Executes the two shell steps of .github/actions/build-native-image/action.yml -- the
akmods-cache announcement and the `buildah build` invocation that produces every image this
repository ships.
Doing: Extracts each step's `run:` body and `env:` block with PyYAML, resolves the block's
`${{ inputs.* }}` expressions the way GitHub resolves them (refusing any expression this
harness does not model), and runs the body under bash against a `buildah` stub that records
its argv one argument per line.
Why: This action is the single place where the base image, the akmods cache, the Homebrew
payload, the in-image signing policy and the seven provenance labels are turned into build
flags, and no tier executes it. tests/test_workflow_build_container.py text-matches workflow
YAML, tests/e2e/ dispatches `ci_tools.cli` commands rather than workflow steps, and
tests/check_coverage.py excludes composite actions from its manifest by design. A build that
lost `--tls-verify=true`, dropped `--format docker` (which host `bootc upgrade` depends on),
built a different Containerfile, or silently stopped labelling the akmods cache digest it
consumed would ship a wrong or unprovenanced image with every existing test green.
Goal: Make a changed build contract fail here rather than on a booted machine, where the
symptom is an image that will not upgrade or whose provenance labels cannot be trusted.

The steps' text is executed rather than copied. A renamed or deleted step, or an input this
harness does not supply, fails loudly instead of leaving this file asserting nothing.

Nothing here builds a container. `buildah` is a stub and PATH deliberately omits the
directories where the real tool lives, so a step that stopped being stubbed would fail rather
than pull from ghcr.io.

PyYAML is not a pytest dependency; CI installs it by name (see .github/workflows/test.yml).
The import is guarded so the suite still runs under `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
with nothing installed, matching tests/test_action_publish_native_image.py.
