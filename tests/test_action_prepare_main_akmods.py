"""
Script: tests/test_action_prepare_main_akmods.py
What: Executes the shell of .github/actions/prepare-main-akmods/action.yml -- the composite
action that resolves every build input, probes the shared akmods cache, and rebuilds and
republishes that cache when it no longer matches the kernel and ZFS version this run resolved.
Doing: Extracts each step's `run:` body and `env:` block with PyYAML, resolves the `${{ inputs.* }}`
and `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.* }}` expressions the way GitHub resolves them (refusing any
expression this harness does not model), and runs the bodies under bash against a `python3` stub
that records the argv and environment of every `ci_tools.cli` invocation the steps spawn.
Why: This action is the front half of the main build, and no tier executes any of its shell.
tests/test_workflow_build_container.py reads this file as text, tests/test_check_akmods_cache.py
and tests/test_classify_akmods_failure.py mention it only in prose, tests/e2e/ dispatches
`ci_tools.cli` commands directly rather than through the steps that wire them, and
tests/check_coverage.py excludes composite actions from its manifest by design. What that leaves
untested is not the helpers -- those are covered -- but the wiring between them, where several
decisions live that are invisible once a job is green: the build's `set -o pipefail` (without it
`tee` succeeds, the step exits 0 and reports a rebuild that never happened), the `2>&1` that puts
the compiler's stderr into the log the classification step later reads, the `rebuilt=true` marker
written only on the success path, the log path that two steps must agree on, and the deliberate
mapping of `ZFS_MINOR_VERSION` to the resolved *patch* version rather than the minor line.
Goal: Make a broken hand-off between these steps fail here rather than as a shared cache that was
republished wrong, a green run that signed nothing, or a sticky issue that never opened.

The action's text is executed rather than copied. A renamed or deleted step, a newly wired input,
or an expression form this harness does not model fails loudly instead of leaving a test asserting
nothing.

Nothing here builds a kernel module or touches a registry. `python3` is a stub and PATH omits the
directories where a real interpreter lives, so a step that stopped being stubbed would fail with
"command not found" rather than start a build.

PyYAML is a transitive pytest dependency and present in CI (see .github/workflows/test.yml). The
import is guarded so the suite still runs under `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` with
nothing installed, matching tests/test_action_rechunk_native_image.py.
