"""
Script: tests/test_action_rechunk_native_image.py
What: Executes the single shell step of .github/actions/rechunk-native-image/action.yml -- the
Chunkah invocation that re-layers every image this repository ships, immediately before it is
pushed and signed.
Doing: Extracts the step's `run:` body and `env:` block with PyYAML, resolves the block's
`${{ inputs.* }}` expressions the way GitHub resolves them (refusing any expression this harness
does not model), and runs the body under bash against a `podman` stub that records each
invocation's argv one argument per line together with the environment the step exported for it.
Why: This action is the last thing that rewrites the image before publication, and no tier
executes it. tests/test_workflow_build_container.py text-matches workflow YAML,
tests/e2e/ dispatches `ci_tools.cli` commands rather than workflow steps, and
tests/check_coverage.py excludes composite actions from its manifest by design. The step encodes
four decisions that are invisible once the job is green: the source image's own config is carried
into the rechunked output via `CHUNKAH_CONFIG_STR`, container storage is pruned *before* the
archive is loaded (the whole reason the build buffers to an archive instead of piping), the load
unpacks under `/mnt` rather than the smaller root disk, and the rechunked image is re-tagged back
onto the tag the caller passed so downstream publication needs no changes. A regression in any of
them produces either a silently misconfigured image or a disk-exhaustion failure thousands of
lines into a build log.
Goal: Make a changed rechunk contract fail here rather than on a booted machine or at the point
where a runner runs out of disk.

The step's text is executed rather than copied. A renamed or deleted step, or an input this
harness does not supply, fails loudly instead of leaving this file asserting nothing.

Nothing here rechunks an image. `podman` and `sudo` are stubs and PATH deliberately omits the
directories where the real tools live, so a step that stopped being stubbed would fail rather
than pull quay.io/coreos/chunkah. `sudo` records what it was asked to do and does not run it, so
the test never touches `/mnt`.

The step buffers through the literal path `/tmp/chunkah-oci.tar`, which is not configurable from
outside; the tests below therefore use that path and assert the step removes it again.

PyYAML is not a pytest dependency; CI installs it by name (see .github/workflows/test.yml).
The import is guarded so the suite still runs under `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
with nothing installed, matching tests/test_action_publish_native_image.py.
