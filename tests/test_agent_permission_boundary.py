"""
Script: tests/test_agent_permission_boundary.py
What: Joins `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/rules/` and `ruff.toml` to the things they claim.
Doing: Re-implements the command-prefix matcher, decides the commands docs/SECURITY-AI.md says are denied, executes the PostToolUse hook, and resolves every path and rule citation the agent configuration names.
Why: These four files configure what an agent may do and what it is told, and until now no test opened any of them.
Goal: Make a dropped deny rule, a broken hook, a moved prompt or a stale claim fail here instead of the first time an agent acts on it.

`docs/SECURITY-AI.md` ("What an agent may do unattended") ends with a table
that says, rule by rule, how much of the never-do list `.claude/settings.json`
actually enforces. That table is the only place the boundary is written down in
words, and the settings file is the only place it is written down in a form a
tool obeys. Nothing joined the two. Concretely, the suite as it stands accepts
all of these one-line edits to the committed tree:

  * deleting `Bash(cosign sign:*)`, `Bash(skopeo copy:*)` or
    `Bash(podman push:*)` from `deny` -- the doc still says "**Denied**", and
    the operations that move a published artifact become promptable;
  * moving `Bash(gh pr merge:*)` or `Bash(gh workflow run:*)` from `deny` to
    `ask` -- both are one click from moving `:latest`, which is the reason
    `settings.json`'s own `_note_deny_publishing` gives for denying them;
  * moving `Bash(gh api:*)` from `ask` to `allow`, which `_note_gh_api`
    explains is a mutation path because `gh api` switches to POST on `-f` and
    honours `-X`;
  * breaking the `PostToolUse` hook body, which is a shell one-liner that no
    test ran.

The matcher is re-implemented here rather than assumed, and it has its own case
table (`PermissionRuleMatcherTests`). Without that, every assertion below could
pass because the matcher says yes to everything.

Two of the assertions are deliberately the other way round: the doc says a
leading `+` in a refspec (`git push origin +main`) and a push to `main`
specifically are *not* expressible as prefix rules, and this file checks that
they are still not denied. If a future rule does catch one, that test fails and
the fix is to update `docs/SECURITY-AI.md` and the `_note_push_orderings` note
-- the honesty of the doc is the thing being held, not the current rule set.

The other three files are the same kind of hand-maintained copy that
`tests/test_contributor_instructions.py` and `tests/test_prompt_catalog.py`
already hold for `.github/`:

  * `.claude/commands/*.md` are thin pointers at `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`.
    Their own README says "if a command here and its prompt disagree, the
    prompt is right", so a pointer at a renamed prompt is a command that sends
    the reader nowhere.
  * `.cursor/rules/zfs-kinoite-complex.mdc` is `alwaysApply: true`, so it is in
    context for every Cursor session, and it carries a fourth copy of the
    seven safety-critical files `AGENTS.md` section 0 rule 2 names.
    `tests/test_labeler_config.py` holds the other three.
  * `ruff.toml` carries a per-file ignore and a comment claiming
    `pyproject.toml` was removed because it described a project that does not
    exist.

Standard library only, and no PyYAML: the CI job installs pytest, pytest-cov
and ruff, so a third-party parser would depend on the runner image and skip
silently the day that changed. The frontmatter here is two or three flat keys,
which is parsed directly.
