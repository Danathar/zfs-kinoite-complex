"""
Script: tests/test_auto_qa_tuning.py
What: Keeps .github/auto-qa-tuning.json in step with the workflow files it describes.
Doing: Reads every `timeout-minutes:` out of .github/workflows/ and compares both directions against the declared jobs.
Why: A timeout changed in YAML leaves the declaration stale, and nothing else would notice.
Goal: Make the tuning file a description of the workflows rather than a snapshot of them.

The declarations are only worth having if they are true. A stale entry is worse
than no entry: it reports headroom against a cap that is not the cap.

Parsed with a small regex rather than PyYAML, for the reason
tests/test_workflow_build_container.py gives at length -- the CI job installs
only pytest, pytest-cov and ruff, so a PyYAML import would depend on whatever
the runner image happens to ship, and would skip silently the day it does not.
