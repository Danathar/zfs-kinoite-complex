"""
Script: tests/test_build_image_brew_fragments.py
What: Tests that the brew payload's login-shell fragments never reach the image, and that the fragment replacing them executes nothing.
Doing: Reads the Containerfile and build-image.sh, extracts the build-time sweep and runs it against fixture trees, and asserts the text of files/etc/profile.d/brew-path.sh.
Why: `COPY --from=brew /system_files /` brings in files this repository does not write, and `brew-setup.service` leaves the prefix they execute from owned by UID 1000, so a login shell that sources them runs user-writable code as root.
Goal: Keep the removal, the sweep that backstops it, and the replacement fragment from quietly drifting apart.

The fragments are not in this tree at any revision, so nothing here can assert
their absence by reading a tracked file. What the suite can pin is the three
things the image build does about them: the removal, the sweep that fails the
build if the payload grows a fourth, and the one fragment that is allowed to
stay. The sweep is extracted and executed rather than pattern-matched, because
the property under test is what it does to a directory tree.
