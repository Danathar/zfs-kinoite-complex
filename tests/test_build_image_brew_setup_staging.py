"""
Script: tests/test_build_image_brew_setup_staging.py
What: Tests that the brew payload's first-boot unit stages its tarball in a private /tmp, and that the build notices if the payload stops staging where that containment reaches.
Doing: Asserts the text of the brew-setup.service drop-in, asserts the build installs it, and extracts the build-time staging check and runs it against fixture unit trees.
Why: `brew-setup.service` comes from `COPY --from=brew /system_files /` and stages 154MB through the fixed path /tmp/homebrew as root, so on a booted system any account that creates that name first chooses part of what lands in the prefix the unit then gives to UID 1000.
Goal: Keep the drop-in, its installation, and the check that backstops it from drifting apart.

The unit itself is not in this tree at any revision, so nothing here can assert what it
does. What the suite can pin is the three things this repository does about it: the
drop-in's content, the install line that puts it on the image, and the check that fails
the build if a future payload revision stages somewhere `PrivateTmp=` does not cover.
The check is extracted and executed rather than pattern-matched, because the property
under test is what it does to a unit file.
