"""
Script: tests/test_editorconfig.py
What: Joins `.editorconfig` to the tree it claims to describe, and to `ruff.toml`.
Doing: Hand-rolls the EditorConfig section matcher, resolves every tracked file through it, and checks the resolved values against what the files actually contain.
Why: Nothing opened `.editorconfig` before this file -- no test read it, no CI job runs an EditorConfig checker, and `tests/check_coverage.py` measures Python statements, so an editor-facing claim could drift from the tree with a green build.
Goal: Make a false claim in `.editorconfig` -- a wrong line length, a dead carve-out, a section that stopped matching the files it names -- fail here.

`.editorconfig`'s own header states its warrant plainly:

    Encodes the conventions already in the tree rather than proposing new
    ones. Every value below was read off the files it applies to: no tracked
    file has a tab, none has trailing whitespace, and every one ends with a
    newline. So nothing here asks for a reformat, and adopting it produces no
    diff.

That is a factual claim about the tree, not a preference, and it is the only
thing that makes the file safe to adopt. If it stops being true, the file
starts proposing a reformat instead of recording one, and the first person to
open a stale file in a conforming editor gets the unrelated-noise diff that
`CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "every changed line traces to the change you set out to
make" exists to prevent. So this suite recomputes the claim rather than
trusting it.

One claim was already false when this file was written. The `[*.sh]` comment
read:

    build_files/build-image.sh continues its long podman/find invocations at
    two spaces. It is the only shell script in the tree; declare what it does
    rather than let an editor fight it.

The tree has three tracked shell scripts -- `build_files/build-image.sh`,
`build_files/check-brew-payload-inventory.sh` and
`files/etc/profile.d/brew-path.sh`. All three indent at two spaces, so the
`[*.sh]` value was right; the sentence justifying it was not. That is exactly
the drift an unread file accumulates, and
`test_the_sh_comment_names_every_tracked_shell_script` is what stops the next
one.

Mutations to the committed tree that the suite accepted before this file:

  * `[*.py] max_line_length = 100` changed to `88`, contradicting
    `ruff.toml`'s `line-length = 100` -- the one setting here that a tool
    really does enforce, and the one the comment says this file follows;
  * `[*.json] indent_size` changed from `2` to `4`, against every JSON file in
    the tree;
  * the `[files/usr/lib/**]` carve-out re-anchored to a path matching nothing,
    quietly putting upstream-verbatim files back under the strict `[*]` rules;
  * `root = true` deleted, which makes EditorConfig keep searching parent
    directories outside the checkout.

The matcher is hand-rolled rather than taken from the `editorconfig` package
because the CI job installs pytest, pytest-cov and ruff and nothing else. A
matcher asserted only against the committed tree would be vacuous -- it could
be wrong in the same direction as the file and every downstream check would
still pass -- so it carries its own case table in
`EditorConfigMatcherTests`, including the cases this repository's own
`.editorconfig` depends on: `LICENSE` must not match `LICENSE.APACHE-2.0`, and
a pattern with no separator must match at any depth while one with a separator
is anchored at the repository root.
