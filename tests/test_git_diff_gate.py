"""
Script: tests/test_git_diff_gate.py
What: Runs `.claude/hooks/gate-git-diff.sh`, the PreToolUse hook that re-gates the allow-listed git commands.
Doing: Feeds the hook real tool payloads and asserts exit 2 for the spellings that read or write an arbitrary file, and exit 0 for the ordinary ones.
Why: The hook is the only control standing between an unprompted `git diff` and this repository's secret-shaped paths, and every refusal in it is one a simpler check would have missed.
Goal: Make a weakened operand scan fail here, rather than the first time a signing key is printed by a pre-approved command.

`.claude/settings.json` allows `git diff`, `git log`, `git show` and
`git blame` with no prompt, and denies the *Read tool* this repository's
secret-shaped paths. Those are different tools, so the deny rows say nothing
about what the allowed commands open or write. The hook closes that, and the
claims it makes are each a separate way for it to silently stop working:

  * the two-operand read mode needs no flag, survives a leading `--`, and
    counts a lone `-` as its second operand;
  * `--output=FILE` writes, in every git subcommand rather than just `diff`,
    and `--output-indicator-*` is a different flag that must keep working;
  * an output redirection on the git command is the shell's spelling of the
    same write -- `git diff HEAD >cosign.pub` truncates the file before git
    starts -- and is refused whatever it targets and wherever it is written
    (`>cosign.pub git diff HEAD` is the same command), while `2>&1`, an
    input redirection, and a redirection on some other command in the
    string stay allowed;
  * an unquoted leading `~` is `$HOME` to bash and a literal directory
    inside the checkout to a scan of the typed words, so `git diff --
    ~/.aws/credentials ~/.bashrc` resolved both operands inside the tree and
    printed both files; such a word is refused in a git invocation, while a
    quoted tilde and `HEAD~1` are left alone;
  * the shell rewrites quoting and backslashes before git sees the word, so
    matching the typed spelling is not enough;
  * brace expansion rewrites it further -- one word becomes two operands, and
    a flag name split across a brace becomes the flag -- so a brace bash
    would expand is refused inside a git invocation, while a literal one
    (git's own `HEAD@{1}`) and every brace outside git are left alone;
  * a `$` or a backtick does the same by another route -- `$(...)` and
    `` `...` `` supply operands the scan never counted, `$'\x74'` rebuilds a
    flag name -- so every word of a git invocation carrying either is
    refused, while an awk or jq program in another command of the string
    is not;
  * the word that names a command must be literal: `git status; G=git; $G
    diff /dev/null ./cosign.key` opens no git scope at `$G` and runs the
    plain-file read, so a command name carrying a `$`, a backtick, a glob
    or a brace bash would expand is refused wherever it stands in the
    string -- every word after a wrapper such as `command` or `env`
    included -- and a literal path to git (`/usr/bin/git diff`) is read as
    git;
  * an assignment before the name is an environment the command runs under
    rather than a word of it, and for these commands that environment is a
    way in: `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=prog git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` runs prog once per
    changed path and `GH_HOST=other gh pr list` sends the token elsewhere, so
    a leading `NAME=value` is refused before git and before a gated prefix,
    and so is an `export` of one that a later command of the same string
    reaches;
  * a wrapper's own option is a name candidate of its own, so a command whose
    words so far cannot grow into a gated prefix starts its prefix over at
    the next candidate -- without that, `env -u X python3 tests/run_tests.py
    >cosign.pub` matched no gated row and the redirection refusal never
    fired;
  * the write primitive is not git's alone: a rule ending in `:*` matches a
    command prefix while a redirection is the rest of the string, so
    `python3 tests/run_tests.py >cosign.pub` truncates the trust anchor and
    `gh run view 1 --log >.claude/settings.json` overwrites the settings file
    with no prompt, and `cosign verify --output-file cosign.pub ...` does the
    same through a flag cosign's root command carries. Both are refused for
    the allow rows that take arguments, while a pipe, a descriptor form, an
    input redirection and a command no allow rule covers stay allowed -- and
    the list of gated commands is derived from `.claude/settings.json` here,
    so a rule added there fails until the hook lists it;
  * a glob is one word here and however many files match at git, so
    `git diff /home/<user>/.ssh/*` is the two-operand read with one operand
    counted, while a quoted `'*.md'` is git's own pathspec and must keep
    working;
  * nothing that decides what a command does has to be written in the
    command: a variable assignment in front of it (`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=`,
    `PYTHONPATH=`, `LD_PRELOAD=`, in either operator and through `env`), an
    `export` in another command of the string, and a git global option
    between the name and the subcommand (`-c diff.external=`, `-C dir`) each
    sit outside the prefix an allow rule matched;
  * an operator character with no whitespace around it still starts a command;
  * a two-token git global option (`--namespace x`) must not be read as a
    subcommand;
  * it fails closed when `jq` is missing, per AGENTS.md section 0 rule 1.

`CorpusTests` at the end of this file holds all of that as data rather than as
prose: the shapes issue #229 names are rows of `CORPUS`, one test drives them,
`UNREACHABLE_SHAPES` checks the ones no allow rule here reaches against the
allow list they depend on, and `MUTATIONS` disables each new rule in a copy of
the hook and requires a row to notice.

The hook is run as a subprocess against a real checkout, because what it
decides depends on `git rev-parse` and `realpath` answering about this tree.
That is also why the gate is listed as `unmeasured` in
`.coverage-thresholds.json`: it is bash, so Python statement coverage never
sees it, and this file is where it is held instead.
