"""
Script: tests/test_issue_templates.py
What: Parses `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml` and joins each form to the files, workflows, labels and prose it names.
Doing: Validates the issue-form schema GitHub silently enforces, then checks every cross-reference resolves in the tracked tree.
Why: A malformed form is dropped from the issue chooser without any error, and the reporting checklists here are hand-copied from CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.md.
Goal: Make a broken form, a stale workflow name, a dead link, or a drifted priority list fail here instead of the first time someone tries to file.

Nothing in this repository opened these four files before. They are ordinary
configuration to `git`, so nothing lints them, and the failure mode is the
quiet one: GitHub does not report a schema error on an issue form. A form with
a duplicate `id`, a `required: "true"` string where a boolean belongs, or a
`markdown` block carrying an `id` simply stops appearing in the chooser. The
first person to notice is a reporter who cannot find the template, and they
file a blank issue instead -- which is precisely the outcome the forms exist to
prevent, since `config.yml` leaves blank issues enabled.

The second half of the file is the more interesting one. These forms are not
self-contained: they are the reporting end of rules written down somewhere
else, copied by hand.

  * `coverage-gap.yml`'s tier dropdown is the numbered list under
    CONTRIBUTING.md "Priority order for a real gap", retyped. Two copies of a
    ranking, and the form is the one contributors actually read.
  * `build-failure.yml`'s workflow dropdown is the contents of
    `.github/workflows/`, retyped. Rename a workflow and the dropdown offers a
    file that no longer exists.
  * `build-failure.yml` tells reporters a persistent akmods failure is already
    filed automatically under the `akmods-failure` label. That string is a
    literal in `akmods-failure-triage.yml`; if it changes there, this form
    sends people looking for a sticky issue under a label nothing applies.
  * Both `build-failure.yml` and `coverage-gap.yml` cite "AGENTS.md section 0
    rule 1" as a required acknowledgement, and `docs/safety-model.md`,
    `docs/install-and-verify.md`, `docs/glossary.md`,
    `docs/building-locally.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md#coverage` are linked as the
    reading a reporter is sent to first.

Labels get their own check. `docs/SECURITY-AI.md` ("Labels carry authority")
records that an external system treats `quality`, `security` and `testing` as
an approval to auto-merge on green CI, and `.github/labeler.yml` keeps every
label it applies inside an `area/` namespace for exactly that reason.
`coverage-gap.yml` applies `quality` and `testing` on purpose -- an issue is
not a pull request and cannot be merged -- but the label set of every form is
pinned here so that adding one to a form is a deliberate edit rather than a
copy-paste, and so no form ever reaches into the path labeler's `area/`
namespace.

The link and marker joins run everywhere. The schema checks need a real YAML
parser, so PyYAML is imported the way the other configuration tests here import
it -- used when present, skipped when not. The `test.yml` job installs it by
name; pytest does not bring it, so the skip is for a checkout with nothing
installed, not for CI.
