"""
Script: tests/test_labeler_config.py
What: Joins `.github/labeler.yml` to the safety-critical file list the agent docs and docs/risk-tiers.md name.
Doing: Resolves every glob against the tracked tree, and checks that every Tier 3 path really does earn `area/safety-critical`.
Why: The label is the input to a blocking review gate, and a path that stops matching fails open -- silently, with a green build.
Goal: Make a rename, a moved file, or a re-namespaced label fail here instead of on a pull request nobody reviewed properly.

`area/safety-critical` is not decoration. `CONTRIBUTING.md` item 3 requires a
statement of what could reach a booted machine when one of the seven files
`AGENTS.md` section 0 rule 2 names changes, and `docs/review-rubric.md` section
2 treats a missing statement as *blocking*. The reviewer learns which tier a
pull request is in from the label. So the failure mode is not "a label is
missing" -- it is that a Tier 3 change arrives looking like a Tier 1 change.

Nothing enforced that list before this file. Two mutations to the committed
tree that the suite accepted:

  * deleting `ci_tools/promote_stable.py` from the `area/safety-critical`
    globs -- a signing-path file that no longer gets the label;
  * renaming `area/tests` to `testing` -- which, per this repository's own
    `.github/labeler.yml` header and `docs/SECURITY-AI.md` ("Labels carry
    authority"), is an auto-merge approval signal to the external Hive system.
    A path-based matcher would then hand that signal to every pull request
    touching `tests/`, with no human approving anything.

Both are one-line edits and both stayed green. That is the argument for
checking the file mechanically rather than trusting review to notice.

PyYAML is imported the way the other workflow tests here import it -- used when
present, skipped when not. The CI job installs it by name; pytest does not bring
it, so the skip is for a checkout with nothing installed, not for CI.
