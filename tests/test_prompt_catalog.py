"""
Script: tests/test_prompt_catalog.py
What: Joins `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` to the code, workflow and agent-doc facts each runbook asserts.
Doing: Extracts every quoted guard message, lock-file field, manifest key, job name and rule citation from the prompts, and resolves each against the tracked tree.
Why: These are operator procedures followed during an incident, and every fact in them is a hand-copy of something that lives somewhere else.
Goal: Make a renamed guard message, a renumbered AGENTS.md rule, a new lock-file field or a moved signing job fail here instead of misleading whoever is holding the pager.

Nothing in this repository opened these four files before. `git ls-files *.md`
reaches them through tests/test_docs_consistency.py, so their *links* resolve --
but a link resolving says nothing about whether the guard message quoted next to
it is still the string the code raises.

The drift here is worse than ordinary doc drift because of when it is read.
`diagnose-build-failure.prompt.md` is opened when a production build is red and
its whole value is the table mapping a refusal message to "upstream problem" or
"escalate immediately, `:latest` has already moved". A message that was reworded
in `ci_tools/` does not make that row wrong-looking; it makes the row
unfindable, and the reader concludes the guard is one the runbook does not
cover. `replay-a-build.prompt.md` is worse still: it tells an operator which
fields to copy into `ci/inputs.lock.json`, and a field the table omits is a
field left at its default, which is the one outcome a replay must not have.

So each check below is a join, not a spell-check:

  * Every message in the diagnose table is matched against the `CiToolError`
    strings `ci_tools/` actually raises, reconstructed with `ast` so an f-string
    split across five source lines compares as one message.
  * Every lock field the replay table names is checked against the real keys of
    `ci/inputs.lock.json`, in both directions. The reverse direction is the
    valuable one: a field added to the lock file that the runbook never tells
    anyone to fill in silently falls back to a default.
  * Every `inputs.<name>` the same table reads from the `build-inputs` artifact
    is checked against the dict `ci_tools/write_build_inputs_manifest.py` emits.
  * Every "AGENTS.md section 0 rule N" citation is resolved against the rules
    that file numbers, with an anchor word per cited rule so a renumbering that
    keeps the count cannot pass.
  * The seven safety-critical paths `review-safety-critical-change.prompt.md`
    lists are joined to rule 2 itself. tests/test_labeler_config.py already
    holds the three agent docs to each other; the prompt is a fourth copy, and
    was in no test.

No PyYAML, for the reason tests/test_docs_consistency.py gives: the CI job
installs pytest, pytest-cov and ruff and nothing else, so an optional import
would skip silently the day that changed. The workflow facts needed here are
job-scoped rather than deep -- which job declares an environment, which job uses
an action -- so the file scans `build.yml` with an indentation-aware reader that
attributes each line to its job, and asserts set equality rather than presence.
