"""
Script: tests/test_risk_tiers_doc.py
What: Joins every tracked file to a tier of docs/risk-tiers.md, the way the page itself assigns one.
Doing: Reads each tier's assigning paragraph for its paths and its `area/*` labels, expands the labels through `.github/labeler.yml`, and set-compares what is left over to a ledger.
Why: The page tells a reviewer how much scrutiny a change needs, and a file it assigns to no tier gets none by default.
Goal: Make a new file that lands in no tier -- or a ledger entry that has quietly gained one -- fail here.

The page has four tests that read it, and each asks one question of one
section: is `.github/rulesets/` in Tier 3, does Tier 3 cover the seven rule 2
files, does every Tier 3 path earn `area/safety-critical`, does Tier 0 repeat
the `paths-ignore` rule. None of them asks the page's own question in the other
direction -- given a file in this tree, which tier is it?

The page answers that in two ways, and this file uses both:

  * Each tier opens with a paragraph that names paths (`tests/`, `Containerfile`,
    the Tier 3 bullet list). Those paths are that tier's.
  * The same paragraph ends "Labelled `area/...`", and "Assigning a tier when the
    labels disagree" says to take the highest tier any label implies. So every
    file a label's globs match in `.github/labeler.yml` is in that label's tier.

A tracked file that neither reaches is in no tier. When this file was written
there were ten, and four of them are not paperwork: everything under `files/`
except `configure_signing_policy.py` is installed into the image by
`build_files/build-image.sh` and runs on a booted machine --
`modules-load.d/zfs.conf` loads the ZFS module at boot, and
`brew-setup.service.d/10-private-tmp.conf` is the `PrivateTmp=yes` drop-in a
security fix added so brew's first-boot unit cannot be steered through a
symlink in `/tmp`. Reverting that drop-in arrives with no `area/*` label and in
no tier.

Which tier those files belong in is a maintainer's decision, not a test's. So
they sit in UNCLASSIFIED below, and the comparison is set EQUALITY: a new file
in no tier fails until it is tiered or recorded, and a recorded file that has
since been tiered (or deleted) fails until its entry is removed. The ledger can
only shrink by someone deciding.
