"""
Script: tests/test_signing_and_bootc_doc.py
What: Joins docs/signing-and-bootc.md to the tree it describes -- ci_tools/sign_image.py,
ci_tools/promote_stable.py, ci_tools/common.py, files/scripts/configure_signing_policy.py,
build_files/build-image.sh, .github/actions/publish-native-image/action.yml,
.github/workflows/build.yml, .github/workflows/akmods-failure-triage.yml and the pages that
cite this one, including the three files that cite it by gotcha number.
Doing: Recomputes each claim instead of restating it. The cosign flags come out of
sign_image.py's real argv by AST; the trust-policy JSON and the registries.d YAML come out of
configure_signing_policy.py by running it; the key path is derived from ci/defaults.json's
IMAGE_NAME through the workflow input that builds it; the publication order is read off the
action's step names and promote_stable.main()'s call order; the three credential mechanisms
gotcha 6 names are each checked where they live; and `gotcha 6` is parsed out of every file
that cites it and resolved against this page's numbered list.
Why: No test at any tier opened this file. Repo-wide, `grep -rn signing-and-bootc tests/`
returned two hits, both sentences inside docstrings, and the end-to-end tier (tests/e2e/)
runs `python3 -m ci_tools.cli` as a subprocess and opens no docs/ file at all. The four
`--cov` paths in .github/workflows/test.yml are ci_tools, shared, containerfiles/zfs-akmods
and files/scripts, so no coverage number at any tier could have shown the hole. At 354 lines
this is the second-largest page in docs/, it is the page README.md, docs/install-and-verify.md,
docs/architecture-overview.md and docs/documentation-guide.md send a reader to for the trust
model, and three files cite one of its numbered gotchas *by number* -- renumbering that list
silently falsifies all three. The page had already drifted: its promotion list gave `latest`
before the audit tag, while promote_stable.main() publishes the audit tag first and carries a
comment explaining why that order is the safe one under run cancellation.
Goal: Make the page fail here when the tree moves under it, in both directions.

Parses Markdown, the two workflow YAML files and the shell step bodies by hand. CI installs
pytest, pytest-cov, ruff and pyyaml and nothing else (see .github/workflows/test.yml), and
PyYAML would parse these files correctly -- but a `jobs:`/step scan that is four lines long
does not need it, and keeping the parser here means these assertions cannot be turned into a
skip by an environment. `_sections`, `_fenced_blocks`, `_numbered_items`, `_bash_words`,
`_links` and `_yaml_blocks` are the whole parser and carry their own case table in
`ParserTests` below, because a hand-rolled parser that is never wrong about a fixture is the
only thing keeping the assertions built on it honest.
