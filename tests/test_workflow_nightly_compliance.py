"""
Script: tests/test_workflow_nightly_compliance.py
What: Tests the shell bodies of .github/workflows/nightly-compliance.yml -- the published-image
job's signature check and the suite job's coverage-gate step -- by extracting them from the
workflow and executing them against recording stubs.
Doing: Parses the workflow with PyYAML, pulls out the `run:` body of a named step, and runs it
under the same shell GitHub uses for `shell: bash`, with `skopeo`, `cosign` and `python3`
replaced by scripts on PATH that record their argv instead of reaching a registry.
Why: Every other signature check in this repository runs at publish time against an image the
same run just built, and each of those is reached by a test. This workflow's two shell bodies
are reached by nothing: no tier executes them, and the only two files that mention this workflow
mention it in a comment and in a documentation-coverage scan. That left three claims resting on
shell alone -- that cosign verifies the digest skopeo just inspected rather than the moving tag,
that the workflow verifies with the same flags docs/install-and-verify.md tells users to pass,
and that a red coverage gate is not swallowed by the `| tee` that copies it into the step
summary.
Goal: Make a nightly job that stops checking what it claims to check fail here, on the pull
request that changes it, rather than at 05:00 UTC as a green run that verified nothing.

The digest invariant is the one worth stating twice. The step inspects `:latest`, records the
digest in the run summary, and then verifies. Verifying `${IMAGE}` instead of the digest would
look identical in every passing run and would differ only when `:latest` moves between the two
commands -- a concurrent production build is enough -- at which point the summary records digest
A while cosign verified digest B, and the job reports that the recorded artifact verified
without ever having checked it. `test_cosign_verifies_the_digest_that_skopeo_returned` is that
race written down: the stub returns a digest the tag does not resolve to, so a step that passed
the tag through fails here.

The coverage-gate body is a pipeline, so its exit status is the status of `tee`, not of
`tests/check_coverage.py`. It survives only because `shell: bash` makes GitHub run it with
`-o pipefail`; the default shell for a `run:` step does not set it. Dropping that one line from
the step would turn the nightly floor gate into a step that always passes, with no other visible
change, so the shell these bodies are run under is read from the workflow rather than assumed.

This runs the workflow's own text. Copying a step into the test would assert that the copy
works; extracting it means a renamed or deleted step fails loudly in `_run_body` rather than
silently testing nothing.

PyYAML is a transitive pytest dependency and present in CI (see .github/workflows/test.yml).
The import is guarded so the suite still runs under `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
with nothing installed, matching tests/test_workflow_publish_badges.py.
