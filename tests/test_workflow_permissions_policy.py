"""
Script: tests/test_workflow_permissions_policy.py
What: Holds every workflow's token permissions to .github/policies/workflow-permissions.json.
Doing: Reads each workflow's top-level and job-level `permissions:` blocks and compares them
with the policy file in both directions: every workflow is listed and every listed workflow
exists; each declared block matches the policy exactly; the jobs that declare a block are
exactly the jobs the policy lists; and no job is left on the repository's default token by
declaring nothing under a workflow that declares nothing.
Why: A workflow's permissions decide what its GITHUB_TOKEN can do -- push an image to GHCR,
push a branch, open a pull request, mint an OIDC token. The only record of what each one is
meant to hold was the workflow itself, so widening a token was a one-line edit inside a file a
reviewer may be reading for the step that changed. docs/SECURITY-AI.md lists widening a
`permissions:` block as something that needs a human decision first; this makes that widening
a second, separate edit to a Tier 3 file.
Goal: A workflow that asks for one more scope fails here until the policy changes in the same
pull request.

The comparison uses a small indentation parser, not PyYAML, so it runs with nothing installed:
tests/test_contributor_instructions.py holds third-party imports under tests/ to a guarded,
skip-when-absent form, and the check this file exists for should never be the one that skips.
The parser is checked against block, inline, quoted and job-level shapes below, so a block it
cannot read fails as a mismatch rather than passing as "no permissions". Where PyYAML is
installed -- CI installs it by name -- one more test holds the parser to what YAML itself reads
from every real workflow.
